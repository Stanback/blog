## Rules for Revision

1. **Change the thesis when your worldview changes**, not when you feel pressure to be fresh
2. **Archive old theses** in the changelog above (transparency)
3. **Never apologize for past positions**—show the evolution
4. **Rate of change:** expect 1-2 major thesis revisions per year maximum
5. **Test against the original physics:** Does this still answer "Can I trust this person's filter?"

## Variants Considered (for reference)

**Variant A — slightly warmer:**
> Software is no longer scarce. Judgment is.
> I build systems, interfaces, and identities for a world shaped by AI abundance.

**Variant B — slightly sharper:**
> Software is no longer scarce. Judgment is.
> I build systems, interfaces, and identities under conditions of AI abundance.

**Chosen version** emphasizes survival and resilience—things that endure pressure.
