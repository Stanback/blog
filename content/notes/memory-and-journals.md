# Memory and Journals

There's a striking parallel between how AI agents manage memory and how humans have always managed knowledge.

**Agents have:**
- Daily logs (`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) — raw capture of what happened
- Long-term memory (`MEMORY.md`) — curated, distilled insights
- Living documents (notes) — evolving, updatable, timeless
- Published pieces (posts) — timestamped, archived

**Humans have:**
- Journals — daily raw capture
- Wisdom/principles — distilled from experience over time
- Working notes — living documents that evolve
- Published writing — timestamped, archived

The workflow is the same: capture raw → distill over time → distinguish ephemeral from evergreen.

## The Tools Echo This

The tools humans build for knowledge management reflect these same patterns:

- **Hand journaling** — The original. Raw, sequential, dated. Morning pages, bullet journals, gratitude logs.
- **Obsidian** — Graph-based, links between notes, emergence over time. Notes as living documents that connect.
- **Logseq** — Daily pages + block references. Hybrid of journal and wiki.
- **Traditional blogs** — Published, dated, frozen. The archive.

Each optimizes for different parts of the capture → distill → publish pipeline.

## What This Site Does

The "Notes vs Writing" distinction on this site follows this model:

- **Writing** = published, dated. Either a fixed point in time, or slowly revised with explicit "Updated" markers. The archive.
- **Notes** = living documents. More ephemeral and fluid. Can change without ceremony. The workshop.

This isn't arbitrary taxonomy. It reflects how memory actually works — some things are events (dated), some things are beliefs (evolving).

## Why It Matters

Both humans and agents face the same problem: **maintaining coherence across discontinuous consciousness**. 

Humans sleep and forget. Agents context-compress and restart. Both need external memory to persist identity.

The interesting question: what patterns emerge when agents have perfect recall of their external memory but zero recall of their internal state? That's a different memory architecture than humans have ever worked with.
