Every technological revolution reshapes jobs. What we talk about less is how it reshapes *becoming*.

For decades, engineering judgment formed through repetition. You started small. You implemented narrow features. You wrote code that broke in predictable ways. You learned where complexity hides. You felt production incidents in your body. You accumulated scar tissue.

The career ladder wasn't just hierarchy — it was a compression gradient. Low-risk tasks at the bottom. Higher-stakes ambiguity at the top. You earned your way upward by surviving increasingly consequential decisions.

AI compresses the bottom of the ladder.

When execution becomes cheap, the lowest-risk implementation work disappears first. The model drafts the code. The scaffold appears instantly. The first pass is no longer the bottleneck.

Which raises a quiet question: If juniors don't accumulate repetition through implementation, where does judgment form?

---

Judgment is not abstract reasoning. It is exposure to constraint. It is the memory of consequences. It is the feel of tradeoffs in your hands.

Historically, apprenticeship solved this. Electricians learned beside master electricians. Machinists trained on real equipment. Journalists rewrote drafts under sharp editors. Designers absorbed taste through critique.

The friction was the curriculum.

If AI removes friction at the execution layer, apprenticeship must migrate somewhere else.

Maybe the first rung becomes evaluation instead of implementation. Maybe juniors learn to critique model output, trace failure modes, define constraints, and decide what not to ship. Maybe mentorship tightens instead of scales.

But something has to replace repetition.

Because a system that optimizes away beginner work risks optimizing away beginner growth. And organizations that stop hiring juniors eventually starve their own future seniors.

---

The ladder does not disappear. It shifts.

The question isn't whether AI will change engineering roles. It's whether we are intentional about how people become engineers in an environment where output is abundant but judgment remains scarce.

Every revolution changes what we build. The more interesting question is how it changes how we learn to build.
