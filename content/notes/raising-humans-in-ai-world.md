What do I teach my daughter when technical skills are being commoditized, but technical sharpness still matters?

## The Skills That Might Win

First instinct:
- **Observational skills** — noticing what others miss
- **Emotional intelligence** — the thing AI can approximate but not embody
- **Cross-disciplinary integration** — connecting dots across fields
- **Technical sharpness** — but as foundation, not destination

The pattern: not specialized depth alone, not soft skills alone. The integration.

## Educational Philosophies

### Montessori
- Independence, self-directed learning
- "Follow the child"
- Prepared environment, hands-on materials
- **Strengths:** Agency, intrinsic motivation, practical life skills
- **Dated?** Maybe assumes a more stable knowledge landscape?

### Reggio Emilia
- Child as protagonist, collaborator, communicator
- Project-based, emergent curriculum
- Documentation as reflection
- **Strengths:** Creativity, collaboration, multiple "languages" of expression
- **Fits AI world?** The emphasis on expression/communication might matter more

### Waldorf
- Imagination-first, delayed academics
- Rhythm, nature, handwork
- Skeptical of technology
- **Strengths:** Creativity, embodiment, slow thinking
- **Tension:** The tech-skepticism might not prepare for AI collaboration

### Unschooling / Self-Directed
- Interest-led, no curriculum
- Trust the child's curiosity
- **Strengths:** Deep intrinsic motivation
- **Risks:** Gaps if curiosity doesn't naturally hit certain foundations

**Question:** Do any of these explicitly prepare for *thinking with* external systems? Or are they all assuming the mind is solo?

## Developmental Frameworks

### Erikson's Stages
1. Trust vs Mistrust (0-1)
2. Autonomy vs Shame (1-3)
3. Initiative vs Guilt (3-6)
4. Industry vs Inferiority (6-12)
5. Identity vs Role Confusion (12-18)
6. Intimacy vs Isolation (young adult)
7. Generativity vs Stagnation (middle adult)
8. Integrity vs Despair (late adult)

**Do these shift in an AI world?**
- Industry vs Inferiority — what does "competence" mean when AI can do the task?
- Identity vs Role Confusion — harder when roles themselves are shifting?
- Maybe a new stage: **Integration vs Fragmentation** — can you hold a coherent self while collaborating with AI?

### Other Developmental Models
- Piaget (cognitive stages)
- Kohlberg (moral development)
- Kegan (subject-object, complexity of mind)

**Kegan might be especially relevant** — his model is about what we can hold as "object" vs what we're "subject" to. AI collaboration requires making your own thinking visible, holding it as object. That's Kegan stage 4-5 work.

## Personality / Cognitive Frameworks

| Framework | What it measures | AI-relevance? |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Big 5 / OCEAN** | Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism | Empirically validated; might predict who adapts well to AI collaboration |
| **MBTI** | Cognitive preferences | Popular but weak validity; the "externalizing thinking" might matter though |
| **Enneagram** | Core motivations/fears | More about self-understanding than prediction |
| **Astrology** | ??? | No validity but social/narrative function |

**Question:** When we externalize thinking to LLMs, what gets revealed vs hidden?
- MBTI's "thinking vs feeling" might become explicit
- Enneagram's core fears might show up in how we prompt
- Big 5's "openness" might predict willingness to collaborate with AI

**Who wins?** Maybe the people who can:
1. Articulate their own thinking (make it legible to AI)
2. Evaluate AI output critically (not just accept)
3. Integrate AI suggestions with their own judgment
4. Stay coherent while collaborating (not fragment)

## Workforce Stratification

Where does this go?

- **AI-augmented elite** — people who use AI as amplifier, pull further ahead
- **AI-dependent middle** — people who rely on AI, replaceable when AI improves
- **AI-resistant niches** — physical work, human connection work, artisanal "no-AI" positioning
- **AI-native generation** — kids growing up with AI as default collaborator

What tier do I want my daughter in? Probably the first — AI as amplifier, not crutch.

**How do you build that?**
- Strong foundations (reading, math, reasoning) so you can evaluate AI output
- Meta-cognitive skills (knowing what you know, knowing what you don't)
- Agency and initiative (using AI for your goals, not just reacting)
- Human depth (the stuff AI can't fake — yet)

## Questions I Don't Have Answers To

- Does "learning how to learn" change when you can always ask an AI?
- What's the role of memorization when retrieval is instant?
- How do you build frustration tolerance when AI removes friction?
- What does "showing your work" mean when AI did the work?
- How do you develop taste when you're exposed to infinite AI-generated content?
