tension: "AI makes better images than you. So why pick up a camera?"

AI can generate a pixel-perfect image of anything I can describe. Star trails over red rocks? Done. Cusco at golden hour? Rendered. A suburban neighborhood in autumn, shot from above? Seconds.

So why do I still have photos on this site? Why does anyone still pick up a camera?

The same reason anyone still writes code.

## The Output Isn't the Point

Here's what AI can do:
- Generate technically flawless images
- Match any style, any lighting, any composition
- Produce infinite variations instantly
- Create scenes that never existed

Here's what AI can't do:
- Be there
- See what you saw
- Remember what you remember
- Witness what happened

That star trails photo from 2007? I was freezing in Poudre Canyon, watching the exposure accumulate, hoping the red light on the rocks would work. The photo is *evidence* that I was there. It encodes a memory. AI can generate a better star trails image — sharper, better composed, more dramatic — but it can't generate that night.

The Cusco overlook? That's my trip to Peru. The specific hike, the specific light, the specific moment I stopped climbing and turned around. AI can render "Cusco from above" with perfect clarity. It can't render *my* trip.

## Photography as Witness

The word "photography" comes from Greek: *photos* (light) + *graphos* (writing). Writing with light. But there's another layer: *graphos* also means *witness*. Photography is witnessing with light.

When I take a photo, I'm saying: *I was here. I saw this. This light existed.*

AI-generated images aren't witnesses. They're confabulations — technically perfect fabrications of moments that never happened. They have no memory because there's nothing to remember. They have no presence because nothing was present.

This isn't a criticism. AI images are useful. But they're a different thing. Generated, not witnessed.

## The Constraint of Reality

In [[Photography as Interface|Part 2]], I wrote about how constraints shape perception. The 35mm frame. The viewfinder type. The physics of light.

Photography adds one more constraint that AI doesn't have: **reality**.

When I photograph something, I'm working *with* what exists. The light is what it is. The moment happens once. The frame excludes more than it includes. I can't add a mountain that isn't there or move the sun.

AI has no such constraints. It can generate anything. Which sounds like freedom, but it's actually the opposite — infinite possibility means nothing is *chosen*. When everything is possible, nothing is necessary.

The constraints of reality force decisions. They make the image *about* something. "I chose to shoot this, not that. In this light, not different light. At this moment, not another."

Generated images aren't chosen from reality. They're specified from imagination. That's not worse — it's just different. And it means they can't do what photographs do: prove that something happened.

## What Survives

If AI makes the *output* trivial, what's left?

**The seeing.** Photography trained me to notice light. The way it falls differently at different times of day. The quality of shadow. The color temperature of artificial versus natural. This perception doesn't require a camera. The camera just made me practice.

**The presence.** You have to be somewhere to photograph it. You have to show up, pay attention, wait for the moment. The discipline of presence doesn't disappear because AI can generate images.

**The memory.** Photos anchor memories. Looking at the Poudre Canyon shot, I remember the cold, the darkness, the patience. AI can't generate that. The image is a key to an experience that actually happened.

**The witness.** "I saw this." That statement has meaning. It's not about the pixels — it's about the testimony. Photography is a form of truth-telling that generated images can't replicate.

## The Parallel to Code

This is the same pattern we're seeing with software:

| Photography | Code |
|-------------|------|
| AI generates better images | AI writes better code |
| The output isn't the point | The output isn't the point |
| Value = the seeing | Value = the judgment |
| Witnessing what happened | Deciding what to build |
| Reality constrains the image | Requirements constrain the system |

In both cases, AI commoditizes the *execution*. What survives is what AI can't fake: the presence, the judgment, the witness.

I don't take photos because I'm better at pixels than AI. I take photos because I was *there* — and the photo proves it.

I don't write code because I'm faster than AI. I write systems because I have *judgment* about what should exist — and the system embodies it.

## The Real Question

Maybe the question isn't "why photography when AI generates images?"

Maybe it's: *what do you want to witness?*

AI can generate anything. You can only witness what you show up for. The constraint of your finite presence is what makes the photograph meaningful. It's proof of attention. Evidence of being somewhere, seeing something, choosing to capture it.

The same is true for building software. AI can generate anything. The question is: what are you paying attention to? What do you notice that's worth building? What's your witness?

*I'm still figuring this out. The photos on this site aren't better than what AI could generate. But they're mine — evidence of moments I actually witnessed. That feels like it means something.*
