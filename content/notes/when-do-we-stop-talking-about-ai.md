tension: "We're drowning in AI discourse. When does that end?"

Every technology eventually becomes invisible.

We don't talk about "electric lights" anymore. Just lights. We don't marvel at "internet-enabled businesses." Every business uses the internet. The modifier drops when the technology becomes the default assumption.

So when do we stop talking about AI?

## The Half-Life of Disruption

**Electricity:** ~30 years. The 1880s were full of "electric" everything — electric lights, electric motors, electric appliances. By the 1910s-20s, electricity was infrastructure. You didn't advertise "electric-powered" because what else would it be?

**The Internet:** ~20 years. "Dot-com" was a category. "Cyber" was a prefix. "Internet companies" were distinct from regular companies. By 2015, that distinction was meaningless. Every company was an internet company or it wasn't a company.

**Digital Photography:** ~15 years. Through the 2000s, "digital camera" meant something specific — as opposed to film. Now "camera" means digital. Film is the one that needs a modifier.

**Mobile:** ~10 years. "Mobile apps" versus desktop apps. "Mobile-first design." By 2017 or so, apps were assumed to be mobile. The modifier became redundant.

Each wave faster than the last.

## The Pattern

Disruption discourse ends when you stop needing to specify the technology.

"AI-powered" will sound as quaint as "internet-enabled" — a modifier from a time when the technology was novel enough to mention. Eventually, software will just be... intelligent. The way software is just connected now. The way cameras are just digital now.

If the pattern holds, we're looking at maybe 5-7 years? By the early 2030s, "AI" might feel like "cyber" does today — a retro prefix from a more excitable time.

## But Here's the Tension

AI is different in one way that might matter: it's *agentic*.

Electricity didn't have opinions. The internet didn't draft your emails. Previous technologies were powerful but passive — they did what you told them, amplified your intent, extended your reach.

AI does things. It generates, decides, acts. It has something like judgment, even if it's borrowed from training data. That's new.

Does that make AI stay salient longer? When the tool isn't just a tool but a collaborator — or a replacement — maybe we keep talking about it?

Or maybe that's what people said about every previous wave. "The internet changes everything!" "Mobile is different!" And they were right, until they weren't, because the change became the new normal.

## When the Tool Disappears

We don't discuss "spell-check powered writing." Spell check is just... there. Invisible. Part of the workflow.

We don't discuss "auto-complete assisted communication." Predictive text is assumed.

AI might follow the same path. Not because it's less transformative — but because transformation, once complete, stops being news.

The question isn't whether AI is a big deal. It obviously is. The question is: **when does the deal get done?** When does the disruption finish disrupting and just become how things work?

## My Guess

We stop talking about AI when:

1. **The modifier drops.** "AI-generated" → "generated." "AI-assisted" → just... how you work.

2. **The absence is notable.** Instead of flagging AI use, we'll flag non-AI use. "Made without AI" will be the artisanal marker.

3. **The discourse shifts.** From "what can AI do?" to "what should we do?" From capability to judgment. From technology to ethics and taste.

4. **The fatigue wins.** We're already tired. The think pieces blur together. At some point, even the most engaged observers will stop reading another "AI will change everything" article.

We're probably 3-5 years from the modifier dropping in casual use. Maybe 5-7 years from "AI" feeling dated as a category.

And then we'll find the next thing to talk about.
