tension: "We're drowning in AI discourse. When does that end?"
---

I'm tired.

Not of AI — of *talking* about AI. The think pieces. The existential threads. The "everything will change" proclamations followed by the "nothing has changed" rebuttals. The breathless announcements and the weary corrections. The discourse.

You're tired too. I can tell because you clicked on a piece called "When Do We Stop Talking About AI?" hoping someone would give you permission to stop.

Here's the thing: every disruptive technology eventually becomes invisible. The discourse ends. The modifier drops. The thing that was going to "change everything" just becomes... everything.

So when does that happen with AI?

## The Exhaustion Is the Tell

Right now we're stuck in a weird loop:

**The existential spiral:** "AI will take my job" → "No wait, AI makes me more productive" → "But if everyone's more productive, fewer people are needed" → "But new jobs will emerge" → "Will they though?" → repeat

**The capability whiplash:** "Look what AI can do!" → "Actually it's wrong half the time" → "The new model is way better" → "Still hallucinates though" → "But it's improving exponentially" → repeat

**The vibe shift:** "AI is going to be amazing" → "AI is going to be terrifying" → "AI is overhyped" → "AI is underhyped" → "I don't know what to think anymore"

The exhaustion isn't a bug — it's a feature. It's how discourse dies. We don't stop talking about technologies because we've resolved the debates. We stop because we're tired of having them.

## The Half-Life of Disruption

Every previous technology wave followed this pattern:

**Electricity:** ~30 years. The 1880s were full of "electric" everything — electric lights, electric motors, electric appliances. People worried about electrocution, job displacement, the transformation of factories. By the 1920s, electricity was just infrastructure. You didn't advertise "electric-powered" because what else would it be?

**The Internet:** ~20 years. "Dot-com" was a category. "Cyber" was a prefix. "Internet companies" were distinct from regular companies. We capitalized "Internet" like a proper noun. We hyphenated "e-mail." People debated whether online shopping would ever work, whether anyone would do banking on a computer, whether kids were being ruined by screens. By 2015, that discourse was exhausted. Every company was an internet company or it wasn't a company.

**Mobile:** ~10 years. "Mobile apps" versus desktop apps. "Mobile-first design." Debates about whether phones would replace computers, whether constant connectivity was healthy, whether anyone would type on glass. By 2017, apps were assumed to be mobile. The modifier became redundant.

Each wave faster than the last. The half-life of disruption discourse is shrinking.

## The Pattern

Disruption discourse ends when you stop needing to specify the technology.

"AI-powered" will sound as quaint as "internet-enabled" — a modifier from a time when the technology was novel enough to mention. Eventually, software will just be... intelligent. The way software is just connected now. The way cameras are just digital now.

If the pattern holds: 5-7 years. By the early 2030s, "AI" might feel like "cyber" does today — a retro prefix from a more excitable time.

## But What About the Jobs?

Here's the existential crisis version: previous technologies displaced jobs gradually enough that we could pretend it wasn't happening. AI is faster.

I wrote about this in [[The SaaSpocalypse|my SaaS piece]]: Microsoft's new AI exec says they're "ichiban" with a team of mostly models. Salesforce hired no software engineers in 2025. The CEO of Anthropic predicts "all code" will be AI-written within a year.

The fear isn't irrational. But here's the thing: we had the same fears about every previous wave, and we stopped talking about them. Not because they were resolved — because we got tired.

The auto workers who lost jobs to robots didn't get them back. We just stopped making op-eds about it. The retail workers displaced by e-commerce are still displaced. We just moved on to other conversations.

The discourse ending doesn't mean the problems end. It means we normalize them.

## The Agentic Difference?

One counterargument: AI is different because it's *agentic*.

Electricity didn't have opinions. The internet didn't draft your emails. Previous technologies were powerful but passive — they did what you told them, amplified your intent, extended your reach.

AI does things. It generates, decides, acts. It has something like judgment, even if it's borrowed from training data. That's new.

Does that keep it salient longer? When the tool isn't just a tool but a collaborator — or a competitor — maybe we keep talking about it?

Maybe. But I remember when people said the same thing about the internet. "It's different because it connects everyone!" "Information wants to be free!" "This changes the nature of human relationships!"

They were right. And we stopped talking about it anyway.

## When the Tool Disappears

We don't discuss "spell-check powered writing." Spell check is just... there. Invisible.

We don't discuss "auto-complete assisted communication." Predictive text is assumed.

We don't discuss "algorithm-curated feeds." That's just how social media works.

AI is following the same path. Not because it's less transformative — but because transformation, once complete, stops being news.

## My Guess

We stop talking about AI when:

1. **The modifier drops.** "AI-generated" → "generated." "AI-assisted" → just... how you work. This is already happening in some contexts.

2. **The absence is notable.** Instead of flagging AI use, we'll flag non-AI use. "Made without AI" will be the artisanal marker, like "hand-crafted" or "organic."

3. **The discourse exhausts itself.** We're close. The think pieces are blurring together. The debates are circular. The takes are recycled. Soon, writing about AI will feel like writing about "the internet" in 2020 — technically accurate but weirdly dated.

4. **New disruption arrives.** Something else will demand our attention. Biotech? Climate tech? Quantum? Something we're not tracking yet? The discourse doesn't end — it migrates.

We're probably 3-5 years from the modifier dropping in casual use. Maybe 5-7 years from "AI" feeling dated as a category.

And then we'll find the next thing to obsess over while the actual changes — the job displacement, the power concentration, the creative disruption — continue quietly in the background, no longer interesting enough to discuss.
