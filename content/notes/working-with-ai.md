I use AI to build and write. Not sometimes—daily. Claude, ChatGPT, local models when they make sense. It's part of my workflow the same way Git or VS Code is.

Some people find this concerning. Others assume it means the work isn't mine. Both reactions miss what's actually happening.

## How I Use It

**For code:** scaffolding, refactoring, pattern recognition. AI is excellent at boilerplate and structure. I still write the architecture, make the judgment calls, and own the decisions. But if I need to convert a function to use async/await, or generate a type from a schema, AI does that faster than I can.

**For writing:** thought partner, not ghostwriter. I'll draft an idea, ask Claude to help me clarify it, then rewrite what it gives me. Sometimes I keep the structure. Sometimes I keep a sentence or two. Always, the thinking is mine.

**For research:** summarizing documentation, finding edge cases, explaining concepts I'm rusty on. It's a better search engine for technical context.

## The Creative Director Shift

Here's the part that surprised me: **this is actually liberating.**

I used to think the shift from "maker" to "orchestrator" would feel like a loss. Less hands-on. Less craft. More... management.

It doesn't feel that way. It feels like being promoted to creative director of your own work.

You know how a director doesn't operate the camera, but the film is still *theirs*? They set the vision, make the calls, decide what works. The craft is in the judgment, not the execution.

That's what working with AI feels like now. I'm not writing less—I'm deciding more. What to build, what's good enough, what needs to be scrapped, what the thing is actually *about*. The taste layer. The strategy layer.

And honestly? I like that work more than I liked grinding through boilerplate. I spent a decade building the judgment to make those calls. Now I actually get to use it, instead of burning cycles on implementation details.

Not everyone will feel this way. Some people love the execution—the craft of the code itself, the satisfaction of a clean implementation. That's valid. But for me, the shift to orchestration has been a relief, not a compromise.

## Where I Don't Trust It

**Judgment.** AI doesn't know when something is a bad idea. It will confidently give you the wrong answer if that's what the pattern suggests.

**Taste.** It optimizes for coherence, not resonance. Left alone, it produces smooth, forgettable prose. You have to fight it to keep your voice.

**Responsibility.** If I ship code that breaks, that's on me. If I publish an idea that's wrong, that's on me. AI is a tool, not a collaborator who shares the consequences.

**Current information.** AI training data has a cutoff. If you're building in a fast-moving space, you can't rely on it to know what shipped last week.

## What Co-Authorship Means

Some of my posts list an AI as a co-author. Here's what that means:

- The structure of the piece came from conversation with the AI
- It proposed framings I wouldn't have thought of alone
- The final text is substantially shaped by its contributions

Here's what it doesn't mean:

- I typed a prompt and hit publish
- The thinking is AI-generated
- I don't stand behind every word

If something is co-authored, it's because the AI meaningfully shaped the output—not just cleaned up my grammar. I mark it because I think transparency matters.

## The Litmus Test

Before I publish anything, I ask: "Would I defend this in a room full of people who know what they're talking about?"

If the answer is no, it doesn't go out. Doesn't matter if AI wrote it, I wrote it, or we wrote it together.

The tool is irrelevant. The accountability isn't.

## Why This Matters

We're in a weird moment where using AI is either a secret or a flex. Neither is useful.

I use AI because it makes me more effective. I don't use it as a replacement for thinking. And I don't pretend I'm doing this alone when the tools are doing real work.

That's the deal. If you think that undermines the work, I get it. But I think hiding it would be worse.
