A frame that keeps clarifying my thinking about AI systems:

**Constraints** bound the mutation space.  
**Prompts** express intent (inherently fuzzy).  
**Code** is the source of truth.

The prompt is not the product. The code that emerges is.

This is why "prompt engineering" feels wrong as a discipline — you're not engineering the prompt, you're engineering the constraints that shape what prompts can produce. The prompt is just the request. The code is the artifact.

Designer's job = Layer 1 (the physics).  
AI handles Layer 2 (mutations within bounds).  
Code is what ships.
