Seeds to explore:

## The Problem

- Everything digital feels like it should be preserved forever
- But infinite accumulation isn't curation
- Most content loses value over time; some gains it
- How do you know which is which?

## Content Lifecycle

```
Create → Evolve → Crystallize → Consolidate → Archive/Trash
```

With AI, consolidation becomes tractable:
- "Here are 8 posts from 2026 about X — what's still true, what aged badly?"
- Publish the synthesis, trash the scaffolding
- Raw pieces were useful for thinking; the distilled take is what's worth keeping

## Physical vs Digital Archival

Someone from church working on archival — what does that practice look like?
- Physical archives: limited space forces decisions
- Digital archives: infinite space removes forcing function
- Maybe the constraint was a feature?

## Information Archaeology

- What survives isn't always what was important
- What was preserved tells us about the preserver
- Future readers will see our choices

## Questions

- What makes something worth preserving vs consolidating vs trashing?
- How do you preserve *access*, not just bits?
- What's lost when you consolidate? Is that loss okay?
- Does "living documents" conflict with archival? Or complement it?

*Seed note. Revisit when there's actual old content to deal with, or when the thinking crystallizes.*
