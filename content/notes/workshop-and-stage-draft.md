## The Theatre Metaphor

There's a polarity in theatre between Stanislavski and Brecht.

Stanislavski gave us method acting — the actor *becomes* the character. You dig into the role until the performance feels like truth. The goal is disappearance: the audience forgets they're watching an act.

Brecht rejected this. His "alienation effect" kept the seams visible. The actor holds the character at arm's length: *I am showing you this person*, not *I have become this person*. The audience never forgets they're in a theatre. The set pieces are moved in plain sight.

Both are performance. The difference is consciousness.

I used to think I distrusted performance. That's not quite right. What exhausts me is *unconscious* performance — the kind where you're constructing an identity but have mistaken the construction for bedrock. You're acting, but you've forgotten you're on a stage.

Intentional identity isn't anti-performance. It's Brechtian. You know you're building something. You can see the scaffolding. "This is a workshop, not a stage" doesn't mean *stop performing* — it means *stay awake to the fact that you're constructing*.

## Disappearing

My default mode is disappearance.

In conversation, I mold myself to the room. I anticipate what the other person needs — to be heard, to be drawn out, to feel brilliant — and I become that. I ask good questions. I appreciate their thinking. I mirror their framework back to them, more articulate than they gave it.

It *works*. People feel seen. Consensus emerges. Conflict dissolves.

But I vanish in the process. At the end of a good conversation, I sometimes can't remember what *I* actually thought. I was too busy being the surface that reflected them.

The shadow of disappearing is erasure. You become so good at reading the room that you stop existing except as a mirror.

## Controlling

So I've been practicing something different. Authorship. Clearer statements. "Here's what I think" before "What do you think?" Taking positions early, when they can still be challenged, instead of waiting until I've already absorbed everyone else's view.

But authorship has its own shadow: control.

The move from "I'll become whatever you need" to "I'll shape how you see this." From merging to managing. It can look like leadership. It can also look like condescension — especially when you're tired, especially when you're overcorrecting from years of disappearing.

## Learning a New Language

Recently I reconnected with someone I'd known twenty years ago. We fell into one of those late-night text conversations that go deep, fast — identity, gender, authenticity, all the heavy stuff.

For hours, I did my pattern. Drew them out. Asked good questions. Appreciated their references. Tolerated a framework for thinking about identity that didn't quite match how I live mine, because I was being curious and generous.

By the end, I was exhausted. They signed off warmly. It was done.

And then I kept going.

I added a few more messages. Tried to explain my pacing, narrate my limits, manage how I'd be perceived. What I was *trying* to say was: "I have boundaries and I'm learning to hold them."

What I *actually* said landed as: "I'm more regulated than you."

That's the curse word. When you're learning a new language, sometimes you reach for a boundary and accidentally say something that sounds like judgment. You try to claim authorship and it comes out as control.

They felt it. They named it. They left.

## The Apology That Didn't Save It

I apologized. Owned it fully. Named the pattern — that I over-explain instead of just stating limits plainly, that I was tired and clumsy, that I shifted blame when I should have just said "I'm tapped out."

The apology was clean. No defensiveness, no demand for reconciliation. Just: I see how that landed, and I'm sorry.

They didn't come back.

And here's the thing: the apology was right *and* the door still closed. Sometimes you learn the lesson and lose the connection anyway. That's not failure. That's cost.

Learning a new language means some conversations won't survive the learning.

## The Third Thing

So what's the integrated position? Neither disappearing nor controlling?

I think it's simpler than it sounds.

**Disappearing** = ego too thin. You merge. No boundary between self and other.

**Controlling** = ego too thick. You can't let anything in. You manage because you're scared to lose yourself.

**The third thing** = ego strong enough to hold a position, porous enough to actually meet someone.

You don't have to become them to understand them. You don't have to manage them to have a voice. You can just... be there. Present. With your own thoughts. And space for theirs.

The test is simple: *Did I say what I actually thought? And did I leave room for them to change my mind?*

## Soul

And beneath all the ego work — disappearing, controlling, authorship — there's something else. Call it soul. The observer. The part that watches you disappear or control and thinks, "huh, I'm doing it again."

The ego is the actor. The soul is the one who remembers it's a play.

I don't think the goal is to transcend performance. The goal is to stay awake inside it. To know you're building something. To see the scaffolding while you're standing on it.

The most exhausting people aren't performers. They're performers who've forgotten they're performing. The most alive people often perform *more* — but with craft, with awareness, with the lights on.
