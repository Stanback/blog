## Viewfinder as UI

<!-- The viewfinder is literally a user interface — a window into possible futures -->

## Framing = Viewport Design

<!-- What you include, what you exclude. The frame is the first design decision. -->

## Composition = Visual Hierarchy

<!-- Rule of thirds, leading lines, negative space — these are layout principles -->

## Depth of Field = Focus and Attention

<!-- Shallow DoF directs the eye. Deep DoF gives context. Same tradeoffs in UI. -->

## Exposure = Information Density

<!-- Overexposed = too much information, washed out. Underexposed = not enough, lost in noise. -->

## Controls Shape Perception

<!-- "We become what we interface with" — the camera's constraints train how you see -->

## Feedback Loops: Film vs Digital

<!-- Film = waterfall (batch, delayed feedback). Digital = CI (immediate iteration). -->

## The Camera as Constraint System

<!-- Fixed lens forces movement. Manual focus forces attention. Constraints aren't limits — they're teachers. -->
