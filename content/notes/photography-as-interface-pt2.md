## The Viewfinder Is a UI

When you raise a camera to your eye, you're not seeing reality. You're seeing reality *through an interface*.

The viewfinder crops. It flattens 3D to 2D. It adds a frame where there wasn't one. Suddenly the world has edges, and those edges matter.

This is interface design at its most literal: a rectangle that mediates between you and everything else.

## Framing as Viewport Design

What you include in the frame is a choice. What you *exclude* is the more important choice.

Photography taught me this before I ever built a UI: **every interface is an act of exclusion**. You can't show everything. The skill is knowing what to leave out.

A cluttered photo and a cluttered dashboard fail the same way — too much competing for attention, nothing clearly mattering.

## Composition as Visual Hierarchy

Where does the eye go first?

In photography: leading lines, rule of thirds, contrast, light. You learn to guide attention without words.

In interfaces: the same principles apply. Size, position, contrast, whitespace. The best UIs feel like good photos — your eye knows where to land.

I didn't learn visual hierarchy from design school. I learned it from trying to make a portrait where the subject's eyes were the first thing you saw.

## Depth of Field as Focus

Shallow depth of field isolates the subject. Everything else blurs into context.

This is attention design. You're telling the viewer: *this matters, that doesn't*. The blur isn't absence — it's intentional de-emphasis.

Interfaces do this with:
- Progressive disclosure
- Disabled states
- Background/foreground relationships
- Modal focus traps

When everything is sharp, nothing is. When everything has equal visual weight, nothing stands out.

## Exposure as Information Density

Overexpose a photo and you lose the highlights — data literally disappears into white. Underexpose and you lose the shadows — detail crushed to black.

Good exposure is about *retaining information* across the full range.

Interfaces have the same challenge. Too much density and users drown. Too little and they're clicking through empty screens to find substance. The goal is the right amount of information at the right moment.

## Controls Shape Perception

Here's the subtle thing: camera controls don't just capture reality. They *shape what you notice*.

When I shot with a 50mm prime, I started seeing in 50mm. I'd walk down the street and mentally frame shots at that focal length. The constraint became a lens (literally) for perception.

Switch to a 24mm wide angle and suddenly you notice relationships between objects, context, environment. The tool changes what you *see*, not just what you capture.

Software works the same way. The tools we use shape how we think. A spreadsheet makes you see grids. A Kanban board makes you see flows. Figma makes you see components.

**We become what we interface with.**

## The Feedback Loop

Film photographers waited days or weeks to see results. The feedback loop was slow. You had to *imagine* what you were getting.

Digital changed everything. Instant review. Chimp the shot, adjust, reshoot. The feedback loop collapsed to seconds.

This is the difference between deploying to prod once a quarter and continuous deployment. Between annual reviews and real-time analytics. Tighter feedback loops change behavior.

I learned to iterate from digital photography before I learned it from agile.

## The Camera as Constraint System

Every camera is a constraint system:
- Sensor size bounds dynamic range and low-light performance
- Lens mount limits what glass you can use
- Autofocus speed constrains what moments you can capture
- Buffer depth limits burst shooting

These constraints aren't bugs. They're the *physics* of the tool. Working within them — or choosing different constraints — is the craft.

Sound familiar? Every tech stack is a constraint system too.

## What I Learned

**1. Interfaces shape perception.** The tool isn't neutral. It changes what you notice, how you think, what feels possible.

**2. Exclusion is the skill.** Framing is editing. Every interface is a choice about what *not* to show.

**3. Attention is designed.** Composition, focus, hierarchy — these aren't decorative. They're how you guide someone through an experience.

**4. Feedback loops matter.** How quickly you see results changes how you work, how you learn, how bold you're willing to be.

**5. Constraints are the medium.** You don't fight the physics. You learn them, then create within them.

The camera taught me interface design before I knew what interface design was. Raise it to your eye, and you're immediately making decisions about attention, hierarchy, inclusion, exclusion.

Every interface is a viewfinder. The question is: what are you framing?
