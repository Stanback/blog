# On Vulnerability

*This is a seed document. Add to it over time.*

## The Drafts Insight

Tonight I realized: drafts aren't just "unfinished posts." They're a different emotional register entirely.

Drafts are the stuff I'm not ready to defend. Ideas that might be wrong. Might be embarrassing. Might change completely. The vulnerable layer.

Notes are thinking in public — I'm okay being seen mid-process there.

Writing is planting the flag — ready for scrutiny.

But drafts? Drafts are *intimate*. They're where ideas are too fragile for even friendly exposure.

Why does this distinction matter? Because **not everything needs to be ready for public consumption to be worth writing down.** The pressure to perform readiness kills a lot of thinking before it starts.

## Imposter Syndrome or Just... Exposure?

Asked tonight: "Am I being pretentious?"

The real question underneath: "Am I allowed to have opinions in public?"

Imposter syndrome isn't always about competence. Sometimes it's about *visibility*. You can know your stuff and still feel like a fraud because you're used to operating with more cover.

Publishing philosophy. Showing the workshop. Documenting how you think. That's more exposed than shipping code. Code hides behind functionality. Writing exposes the person.

## From the Fireside Draft

> "Authenticity isn't comfortable. It's coherent."

Coherence is the opposite of hedging. When you stop performing a version of yourself, your judgment gets clearer. You stop asking "what should I think?" and start asking "what do I actually think?"

That clarity is useful. It's also terrifying. You can't hide behind ambiguity anymore.

## Vulnerability ≠ Weakness

(Expand this)

The cliché reading of "be vulnerable" is softness, confession, showing weakness.

But there's another kind of vulnerability: **the exposure that comes from taking a position.** From saying "this is what I think" when you could hedge. From publishing when you could keep it private. From leading when you could follow.

That's not weakness. That's risk.

## The Speed of Thought Thing

Building in public — talking through ideas and watching them ship in real-time — is a different kind of vulnerable.

You can't polish. You can't hide behind process. The gap between thought and artifact collapses. What comes out is... more raw? More honest? Also more likely to be wrong.

Is that good? I don't know yet.

## Threads to Pull

- Visibility in leadership while trans (from fireside)
- Kindness vs enabling — the vulnerability of holding standards
- "Readiness comes after you say yes" — vulnerability as prerequisite
- The cost of coherence (you can't unsee what you see)
- Why drafts need protection
- Publishing as exposure vs publishing as performance
- The difference between vulnerable and confessional

## Questions I Don't Have Answers To

- Is there a version of vulnerability that's *too* public? Where does useful exposure become exhibitionism?
- How do you build trust with an audience when vulnerability is part of the offering? Does it become a performance?
- What's the relationship between vulnerability and craft? Can work be polished AND vulnerable?
- Is imposter syndrome ever useful signal? Or is it always noise?
