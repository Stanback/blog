There's a polarity in theatre between Stanislavski and Brecht. Stanislavski gave us method acting — the actor *becomes* the character until the performance feels like truth. Brecht rejected this. His "alienation effect" kept the seams visible: *I am showing you this person*, not *I have become this person*.

Both are performance. The difference is consciousness.

What exhausts me isn't performance. It's *unconscious* performance — constructing an identity while mistaking the construction for bedrock. Acting, but forgetting you're on a stage.

I'm not writing this from the other side. I'm mid-process. A few months ago I got feedback at work that landed hard. I remember rereading the message, feeling my chest tighten. It was about presence. Ownership. The way I show up — or don't. It wasn't easy to hear, and some of it was harsh. But it was right. I *had* been disappearing. I'd made it a survival strategy, and it was costing me.

So I'm trying to change. But I don't have practice yet. Sometimes I overcorrect. Sometimes the new language comes out wrong.

## Disappearing

My default mode is disappearance.

In conversation, I mold myself to the room. I anticipate what the other person needs — to be heard, to be drawn out, to feel brilliant — and I become that. I ask good questions. I appreciate their thinking. I become the surface that makes them feel understood.

It *works*. People feel seen. Consensus emerges. Conflict dissolves.

But I vanish in the process. At the end of a good conversation, I sometimes can't remember what *I* actually thought. Just a faint hollowness, like I'd been holding my breath without noticing. I was too busy being the surface that reflected them.

The shadow of disappearing is erasure. You become so good at reading the room that you stop existing except as a mirror.

## Controlling

So I've been practicing something different. Authorship. Clearer statements. "Here's what I think" before "What do you think?" Taking positions early, when they can still be challenged.

But authorship has its own shadow: control.

From merging to managing. It can look like leadership. It can also look like condescension — especially when you're tired, especially when you're overcorrecting.

## Learning a New Language

Recently I reconnected with someone I'd known years ago. We fell into one of those conversations that go deep quickly — identity, authenticity, all the heavy stuff.

For a while, I did my pattern. Drew them out. Asked good questions. Appreciated their references. Worked within a framework that didn't quite match how I see things, because I was being curious and open.

By the end, I was tired — not dramatic, just the kind of tired that comes from a long day and a 5am wake-up. They signed off warmly. It was done.

And then I added one more message.

It wasn't a rant. It wasn't a lecture. It was a slightly unedited, unfinished attempt to say: *I have limits. I'm learning to name them.*

What I was trying to communicate was pacing. What it sounded like was correction.

That gap — between intention and impact — is the part I'm still learning to see sooner.

## The Apology That Didn't Save It

I apologized. Owned it fully — that I over-explain instead of just stating limits plainly, that I was tired and clumsy, that I shifted blame when I should have just said "I'm tapped out."

The apology was clean. No defensiveness, no demand for reconciliation.

They didn't come back. Some doors close even when you do the repair correctly.

Sometimes you learn the lesson and lose the connection anyway. That's not failure. That's cost. Learning a new language means some conversations won't survive the learning.

## The Third Thing

Disappearing is ego too thin — you merge, no boundary between self and other. Controlling is ego too thick — you can't let anything in, you manage because you're scared to lose yourself.

The third thing is somewhere between: strong enough to hold a position, porous enough to actually meet someone.

The test I keep coming back to: *Did I say what I actually thought? And did I leave room for them to change my mind?*

## Different Stages

Context matters. The gradient shifts.

Work is one kind of stage — ownership there means crisp commitments, dates not disclaimers. Parenting is another — our preschool director once gently corrected me for framing things as questions. "Can you put your shoes on?" gives a three-year-old veto power she doesn't need. Just say what needs to happen.

Friendships feel closer to bedrock, but even there: the balance exists. Disappearing into someone else's needs isn't intimacy. It's abandonment of self dressed up as generosity.

Same practice, different calibrations. The work is staying awake enough to know which stage you're on.

## Staying Awake

There's a part of me that watches all this happen. That notices the merge. Notices the control. Notices the correction.

That's the part worth protecting. Not the patterns — the awareness of them. The ability to catch yourself mid-performance and think, "huh, I'm doing it again."

The goal isn't to stop performing. It's to stay awake inside it. To know you're building something. To see the scaffolding while you're standing on it.

Stanislavski said: become the character until it's real.
Brecht said: show the audience you're acting.

The third thing: *be real while knowing you're on a stage.* And know which stage you're on.
