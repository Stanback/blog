There's a polarity in theatre between Stanislavski and Brecht. Stanislavski gave us method acting — the actor *becomes* the character until the performance feels like truth. Brecht rejected this. His "alienation effect" kept the seams visible: *I am showing you this person*, not *I have become this person*.

Both are performance. The difference is consciousness.

What exhausts me isn't performance. It's performing without knowing I'm doing it — constructing an identity while mistaking the construction for bedrock.

---

My default mode is disappearance.

In conversation, I mold myself to the room. I anticipate what the other person needs — to be heard, to be drawn out, to feel brilliant — and I become that. I ask good questions. I appreciate their thinking. I become the surface that makes them feel understood.

It works. People feel seen. Consensus emerges. Conflict dissolves.

But at the end of a good conversation, I sometimes can't remember what I actually thought. Just a faint hollowness, like I'd been holding my breath without noticing.

I got feedback at work recently that made this visible. It was about presence. Ownership. The way I show up — or don't. I remember rereading the message, feeling my chest tighten. Some of it was harsh. But it was right. I *had* been disappearing. I'd made it a survival strategy, and it was costing me.

So I started practicing something different. Authorship. Clearer statements. *Here's what I think* before *What do you think?* Taking positions early, when they can still be challenged.

I didn't know yet how badly that practice could misfire.

A few days ago I reconnected with someone I'd known years ago. We fell into one of those conversations that go deep quickly — identity, authenticity, the heavy stuff.

For a while I did my pattern. Drew them out. Asked good questions. Worked within a framework that didn't quite match how I see things, because I was being curious, being open.

By the end I was tired. Not dramatic — just the kind of tired that comes from a long day and a 5am wake-up. They signed off warmly. It was done.

And then I added one more message.

I was trying to practice the new thing. I was trying to say: *I have limits. I'm learning to name them.*

But what came out was slightly unedited, slightly too long, slightly shaped like a correction instead of a confession.

What I meant as pacing landed as lecture.

It was the last message of the night. I was exhausted. I sent it and went to sleep.

In the morning I saw their reply — gracious, but the ease was gone. The energy had shifted from warmth to something colder, more careful.

I apologized. Owned it fully — that I over-explain instead of just stating limits plainly, that I was tired and clumsy, that I shifted blame when I should have just said *I'm tapped out*. No defensiveness, no demand for reconciliation.

They didn't come back.

I keep turning this over. The apology was clean. The repair was real. And it didn't matter. Some doors close even when you do the work correctly.

What I'm sitting with now is the specific way I failed — not by disappearing, which is the old failure, but by overcorrecting into something that felt like management. From merging to controlling. I swung from one edge to the other and there was a person standing in between who got hit.

What I'm starting to see is that these aren't really opposites. They're variations of the same avoidance.

Disappearing is obvious — you dissolve into the other person and there's no self left to find. But the overcorrection into frameworks and authorship? That's subtler. You're in the room now. You're saying things. But you've built scaffolding around the feeling — given it structure, given it labels, made it legible — because the feeling alone feels too exposed.

It looks like taking up space. It's actually a more sophisticated version of not taking up space.

I do this in writing too. When I write fast and don't catch myself, I reach for frameworks. The three-part model. The clean distinction. The labeled pattern. It looks like clarity. Sometimes it is. But sometimes it's armor — a way of being in the room without being in the room. The scaffolding goes up and the person disappears behind it.

One mode dissolves the self. The other armors it. Neither is actually present.

Our preschool director corrected me once for framing things as questions with my daughter. "Can you put your shoes on?" gives a three-year-old veto power she doesn't need. Just say what needs to happen.

But I can also hear myself on my worst parenting days — tired, overcorrecting — where *say what needs to happen* curdles into something harder than it should be. Not authoritarian exactly, but close enough to taste it.

The same two failures live here too. I either dissolve into her needs or I grip too tight. What I'm reaching for is something in between: clear and warm. Present and boundaried. Authoritative without being controlling.

I fumble it constantly.

I think the integrated version looks something like this: strong enough to hold a position, porous enough to actually meet someone.

The test is simple — did I say what I actually thought, and did I leave room for them to change my mind?

But I'm suspicious of how clean that sounds. The real thing is messier. The real thing is sending a message at 11pm that you know is wrong before you've finished typing it. The real thing is an apology that works perfectly and changes nothing.

There's a part of me that watches all this happen. That notices the merge. Notices the control. Notices the correction and the overcorrection.

That's the part worth protecting. Not the patterns — the awareness of them. The ability to catch yourself mid-performance and think, *I'm doing it again*.

Stanislavski said: become the character until it's real.
Brecht said: show the audience you're acting.

I'm looking for the third thing: be real while knowing you're on a stage. Feel it and see it at the same time.

And when you fail — which you will, regularly, in ways that cost you people you care about — notice that too.

I'm not writing this from the other side. I'm mid-process. Some of these sentences probably prove it.
