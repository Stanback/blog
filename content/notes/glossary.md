A reference for the models, frameworks, and key terms that recur across this site. Each entry links to where it was first introduced.

## Design Physics

*Introduced in [[Design Physics for the Agentic Era]]*

The idea that interface design for AI agents should focus on shaping the space where behavior happens, not prescribing specific behaviors. Rules break. Physics hold.

**The 2×2:** Legibility (can the agent read?) × Agency (can the agent act?) creates four quadrants that predict interface outcomes.

## Code Owns Truth

*Introduced in [[Design Physics for the Agentic Era]]*

The three-layer model for AI systems:

1. **Constraints** (context engineering) → bounds the mutation space
2. **Prompts** (mutation layer) → expresses intent, inherently fuzzy
3. **Code** (source of truth) → deterministic, versioned, testable

Prompts are suggestions. Code is the artifact that persists.

## Proof Not Truth

*Introduced in [[Proof, Not Truth]]*

The epistemological stance that in adversarial or high-stakes domains, we should optimize for *provable claims* over *true claims*. Truth requires omniscience; proof requires evidence. Build systems that generate receipts, not assertions.

---

## Vulnerability Gradient

*Introduced in [[What Cameras Taught Me About AI]]*

The spectrum from safe to exposed in creative work:

- **Safe end:** Technical competence, gear mastery, process optimization
- **Exposed end:** Taste, judgment, what you choose to point the camera at

AI compresses the safe end. The exposed end is where human contribution lives.

---

## Cost Signals

*Introduced in [[What Cameras Taught Me About AI]]*

The markers that make writing (or any work) feel lived-in rather than generated. Humans are legible through what things *cost* them:

- A changed belief
- A misstep with real consequences  
- A concrete scene (time, place, tension)
- Embodied detail

The test: "Could someone else have written this?"

---

## Judgment as Moat

*Core thesis, appears across multiple posts*

In an era where AI makes execution cheap, discernment becomes the scarce resource. The shift is from maker to orchestrator — both are real work, but the leverage point moves from "can you build it?" to "should you build it?"

---

*This glossary evolves as new models emerge. If a term appears in 3+ posts, it probably belongs here.*
