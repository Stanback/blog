I asked an AI to help me outline this essay. It gave me three angles I'd already read — the historical pattern, the labor displacement argument, the "taste becomes the new moat" reframe. Perfectly adequate. Instantly forgettable. The kind of thing that could be published on any Substack tomorrow and get a few hundred polite likes.

That's the thing I can't stop sitting with. Not the discourse itself, but how cheap it's become to produce.

There's a version of this essay that frames AI discourse exhaustion as something new and unprecedented. I almost wrote it. The pitch would be: AI is the first technology that participates in its own debate, generating the enthusiasm and the skepticism and the nuanced middle take, spinning the flywheel until we can't keep up.

That's a nice line, but it's mostly wrong.

The printing press participated in its own discourse. Television shaped the conversation about television. Twitter was the dominant platform for debating whether Twitter was destroying society. Technologies have always been entangled with the conversations about them.

What's actually different this time is simpler and, I think, more unsettling: AI has made it nearly free to produce adequate commentary on anything, including itself.

The discourse isn't being written by AI in some dramatic, recursive way. It's being *flooded* — by humans using AI to write faster, to publish more, to generate takes at a volume that outpaces anyone's ability to absorb them. The signal-to-noise ratio hasn't shifted because the signal changed. It shifted because the noise got cheaper.

That's why the exhaustion feels different from previous tech debates. The internet discourse of the early 2000s wore people out through slow repetition — the same arguments recycled across years of magazine covers and conference panels until everyone moved on. This one is wearing people out through volume. The think pieces aren't blurring together because we've been having the conversation too long. They're blurring because there are too many of them and they all sound roughly the same, because "roughly the same" is what you get when production costs drop to zero.

I want to tell you a small, specific thing that happened to me last month.

I was reading a thread about creative workers being displaced by generative tools — illustrators, copywriters, junior designers losing work. The kind of thread that would have made my stomach drop a year ago. And I noticed I was skimming.

Not because the stories weren't real or the people weren't hurting. Because I'd seen this thread before. Or something close enough that my nervous system couldn't tell the difference.

That's the part that unsettles me. Not the displacement itself, but the moment I caught myself normalizing it. The shrug that arrived before I'd decided to shrug.

I think this is how discourse actually dies. Not through resolution — we never resolve these debates. Not even through boredom, exactly. Through a kind of saturation where your capacity for a topic quietly fills up and the new information just runs off the surface. You're still aware. You just can't feel it anymore.

The auto workers who lost jobs to robots in the 1980s didn't get them back. We just stopped writing op-eds about it. The creative workers being displaced now won't all find new roles. We'll just stop finding that interesting. Not because anyone decided it was fine, but because the conversation moved on and the people affected didn't have the platform to pull it back.

That's not a prediction about AI. It's an observation about how discourse works, and it's the same every time. The uncomfortable part is watching it happen while it happens — noticing the normalization in progress and knowing your own fatigue is part of the machinery.

Because here's what I've come to believe: normalization doesn't require your consent. It just requires your bandwidth to run out.

And the specific thing AI does — the thing that actually is new — is accelerate the bandwidth depletion. Not by writing the discourse. By making it so cheap to produce that the volume becomes unprocessable. A hundred blog posts about the future of work, all competent, none essential, each one taking a small slice of your attention budget until there's nothing left for the hundred-and-first, which might have been the one that mattered.

The flood isn't sinister. Nobody's orchestrating it. It's just what happens when the cost of adequate writing approaches zero and the platforms still reward volume. The result is a discourse environment where everything is roughly right and nothing cuts through, and the exhaustion that produces is functionally identical to resolution. We stop talking about it. The questions remain. The conditions settle.

People keep reaching for the historical analogies — electricity took thirty years to become invisible, the internet compressed it to twenty, mobile to ten. If the pattern holds, "AI-powered" will sound as dated as "internet-enabled" by the early 2030s.

I used to find that reassuring. The pattern says things settle down.

But the pattern also says that what settles isn't the problem. It's the conversation about the problem. The displacement continues. The concentration continues. We just run out of things to say about it that feel new, and then we move on to whatever demands our attention next — biotech, climate, quantum, something we're not tracking yet — and the unanswered questions quietly become the conditions we live in.

---

I don't have a clean ending for this.

I started writing it thinking I'd arrive somewhere — a framework, a prediction, at minimum a reframe that felt useful. I haven't, entirely.

What I have is this: the discourse about AI is dying faster than previous technology debates, and the primary reason is that AI makes it cheap to produce more discourse than anyone can absorb. That's not poetic and it's not recursive and it doesn't make for a great opening line. But I think it's what's actually happening.

And underneath the discourse, the real changes continue — the jobs restructuring, the power concentrating, the question of what education and craft and expertise mean when the knowledge part is commoditized. Those things won't stop when we stop talking about them. They'll just stop being interesting enough to discuss.

My own fatigue is load-bearing in that process. So is yours. We're not failing to pay attention. We're being outpaced. And the gap between our attention and the volume of the conversation is where the normalization lives.

I don't know when the modifier drops. I don't know when "AI" starts to sound like "cyber" — a retro prefix from a more excitable era. But I know that when it happens, it won't be because we figured anything out. It'll be because we got tired.

And the things we were tired of talking about will still be happening, just quietly, no longer novel enough for a think piece.
