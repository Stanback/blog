tension: "AI agents have identity files. Why don't we?"

## The Weird Thing I Did

On my [About page](/about/), I published my SOUL.md and SKILL.md — standard identity files from the AI agent spec. Yes, I'm a human using an agent identity format for my personal blog.

Call it method acting for the agentic era.

But here's what surprised me: the exercise of writing them was genuinely useful. Not as a gimmick — as a *practice*.

## What SOUL.md Forces You to Articulate

A SOUL.md isn't a bio. It's not a resume. It's a document that answers:

- **Purpose** — Why does this space exist? What's it for?
- **Values** — What do I actually care about? (Not performatively — actually.)
- **Voice** — How do I communicate? What's my texture?
- **Relationship** — Who am I talking to? What do I assume about them?

These questions feel obvious until you try to write clear answers. Then you realize how much you've been operating on vibes.

## What SKILL.md Forces You to Articulate

SKILL.md is different. It's not "what I've done" (resume) — it's "how I think about craft":

- **What I'm good at** — Not credentials. Demonstrated capability.
- **How I approach building** — My defaults, my heuristics, my taste.
- **Tools I reach for** — And why.
- **What I'm learning** — The edges of my competence.
- **Working with me** — What to expect.

Writing this down forces a kind of self-audit. What *do* I actually believe about how software should be built? What *are* my defaults?

## The Clarity Benefit

Even if no one reads these files, writing them is valuable.

The act of articulating your values, voice, and craft philosophy *forces clarity*. You can't hide behind vague intuitions. You have to commit to sentences.

And sentences can be wrong. Which means they can be revised. Which means you can actually *update your beliefs* instead of carrying around unexamined assumptions.

This is why journaling works. This is why writing is thinking. SOUL.md and SKILL.md are just structured prompts for a specific kind of self-reflection.

## The AI Benefit

Here's the other thing: AI is going to work with us more, not less.

If you use AI assistants — Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, whatever — they're trying to understand your intent, your preferences, your context. Right now, they mostly guess. Or you re-explain yourself every session.

What if they could just read your SOUL.md?

Not in a creepy way. In a "here's who I am and how I work" way. The same way you'd onboard a new colleague.

Documented identity becomes *infrastructure*. Your values and craft philosophy aren't locked in your head — they're legible, portable, reusable. An AI assistant that knows your SOUL.md can calibrate its tone, its assumptions, its suggestions.

This isn't sci-fi. It's basically how agent systems already work. The agent has a SOUL.md. It reads it at startup. It behaves accordingly.

Humans can do the same thing — for themselves, and for the systems they interact with.

**Here's my position: SOUL.md is personalization for the agentic era.**

Not algorithmic personalization — where platforms guess what you want based on surveillance. Declarative personalization — where you *tell* systems who you are, what you value, how you work. You control the input. The system adapts to your documented identity, not its inferences about your behavior.

This is a better model. More honest, more portable, more human.

## USER.md vs SOUL.md

There's a related concept worth distinguishing: USER.md.

I first encountered this in [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), an AI agent framework. A USER.md is the agent's notes *about* its human — context it's gathered, preferences it's observed. A model of who you are, built from the outside.

A SOUL.md is different. It's *your* declaration of who you are, written by you.

| | USER.md | SOUL.md |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Author** | Someone else (or an AI) | You |
| **Perspective** | External observation | Internal declaration |
| **Content** | What they've noticed about you | What you want to be true |
| **Energy** | "Here's what I know about Bri" | "Here's who Bri is becoming" |

The distinction matters because **inferred identity and declared identity are not the same thing**.

A USER.md might say: "Bri is a systems thinker who values clean architecture." True — but passive. It's pattern-matching on behavior.

A SOUL.md says: "I believe software should be built for maintainability first. I value leverage and reusability over clever one-offs. When I encounter a problem, my first instinct is to ask what system produced it." That's a *commitment*. Something to be accountable to.

USER.md is how the world sees you.
SOUL.md is who you're choosing to be.

Both are useful. But only one is yours.

## The Social Benefit

There's a third angle: legibility to other humans.

Resumes are optimized for HR filters. LinkedIn profiles are optimized for recruiters. Neither tells you what someone is actually like to work with, what they care about, how they think.

A SOUL.md does.

Imagine if everyone you collaborated with had a documented statement of values and working style. Not a performance — an honest articulation. "Here's what I care about. Here's how I communicate. Here's what to expect."

The bar for this is low because almost nobody does it. Just writing *something* puts you ahead.

## How to Start

You don't need to use the exact format. The structure matters less than the practice. But if you want a starting point:

**SOUL.md:**
1. Purpose — Why are you here? What's this space for?
2. Values — What do you actually care about? (3-5 things, specific)
3. Voice — How do you communicate? What's your texture?
4. Invitation — What do you want from the reader?

**SKILL.md:**
1. What I'm good at — Demonstrated, not credentialed
2. How I approach work — Defaults, heuristics, philosophy
3. Tools — What you reach for and why
4. Learning edges — Where you're growing
5. Working with me — What to expect

Write a draft. It'll be bad. Revise it in six months. That's the point.

## The Meta Point

We're entering an era where AI agents have documented identities and humans don't.

That's backwards.

If machines are going to understand us, work with us, and represent us — maybe we should be explicit about who we are. Not for the machines. For ourselves.

SOUL.md isn't just an agent spec. It's a practice of self-knowledge. And in a world that's about to get very weird, knowing who you are might be the most important skill of all.
