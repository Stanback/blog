I sat down to write a standard About page and got stuck on the third sentence.

"I build things for the internet" — fine, but that could be anyone. "I care about craft and clarity" — true, but so does every other engineer's bio. I kept writing sentences that were accurate and empty. They described me the way a resume does: from the outside, with the texture removed.

Then I tried a different format. I borrowed the `SOUL.md` spec from AI agent frameworks — the file that tells an agent who it is, what it values, how it communicates. I wrote one for myself. Purpose, values, voice, relationship to the reader. And halfway through, I stopped typing and sat there, because I'd written something uncomfortably honest about why I build things — and I hadn't meant to.

That's what I want to talk about. Not the format. The thing that happens when you use it.

On my [About page](/about/), I published the result — a `SOUL.md` and `SKILL.md`. A human using an agent identity format for a personal blog. Method acting for the agentic era. What surprised me: the exercise of writing them was genuinely useful. Not as a gimmick — as a practice.

A `SOUL.md` isn't a bio. It's not a resume. It answers a different set of questions:

**Purpose** — Why does this space exist? What's it for?

**Values** — What do I actually care about? Not performatively. Actually.

**Voice** — How do I communicate? What's my texture?

**Relationship** — Who am I talking to? What do I assume about them?

These feel obvious until you try to write clear answers. Then you realize how much you've been operating on vibes.

A `SKILL.md` works the same way for craft. Not "what I've done" — that's a resume. It's "how I think about building": your defaults, your heuristics, your taste. What tools you reach for and why. What you're learning. What it's like to work with you.

Writing it down forces a self-audit you didn't know you needed.

---

Even if no one reads these files, the writing is valuable.

Articulating your values and craft philosophy forces clarity. You can't hide behind vague intuitions. You have to commit to sentences. And sentences can be wrong — which means they can be revised, which means you can actually update your beliefs instead of carrying around unexamined assumptions.

This is why journaling works. This is why writing is thinking. `SOUL.md` is just a structured prompt for a specific kind of self-reflection.

---

But there's a practical dimension too, and it's about to matter a lot.

AI assistants are trying to understand your intent, your preferences, your context. Right now, they mostly guess. Or you re-explain yourself every session.

What if they could just read your `SOUL.md`?

Not in a surveillance way — in the way you'd onboard a new colleague. *Here's who I am and how I work.*

This is already how agent systems function. The agent has a `SOUL.md`. It reads it at startup. It behaves accordingly. Humans can do the same thing — for themselves and for the systems they interact with.

The important distinction is between two kinds of personalization.

**Algorithmic personalization** is what we have now: platforms guess what you want based on your behavior — your clicks, your purchase patterns, your engagement metrics. They build a model of you from your exhaust.

**Declarative personalization** is different. You *tell* systems who you are, what you value, how you work. You control the input. The system adapts to your documented identity, not its inferences.

That's a better model. More honest, more portable, more human.

There's a related concept worth knowing: `USER.md`.

I first encountered this in [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), an AI agent framework. A `USER.md` is the agent's notes *about* its human — context it's gathered, preferences it's observed. A model of who you are, built from the outside.

A `SOUL.md` is your declaration of who you are, written by you.

The difference matters.

A `USER.md` might say: "Bri is a systems thinker who values clean architecture." True, but passive — it's pattern-matching on behavior.

A `SOUL.md` says: "I believe software should be built for maintainability first. I value leverage and reusability over clever one-offs. When I encounter a problem, my first instinct is to ask what system produced it."

That's a commitment. Something to be accountable to.

`USER.md` is how the world sees you. `SOUL.md` is who you're choosing to be. Both are useful. But only one is yours.

---

There's a third angle I didn't expect: legibility to other humans.

Resumes are optimized for HR filters. LinkedIn profiles are optimized for recruiters. Neither tells you what someone is actually like to work with, what they care about, how they think.

A `SOUL.md` does.

Imagine if everyone you collaborated with had an honest articulation of their values and working style. The bar is low because almost nobody does it.

Just writing *something* puts you ahead.

---

If you want to start, the structure matters less than the practice. But a starting point:

For a `SOUL.md`: Purpose (why are you here?), values (3-5 things, specific), voice (how do you communicate?), and invitation (what do you want from the reader?).

For a `SKILL.md`: What you're good at (demonstrated, not credentialed), how you approach work (defaults, philosophy), tools (what and why), learning edges (where you're growing), and working with you (what to expect).

Write a draft. It'll be bad. Revise it in six months. That's the point.

---

We're in an era where AI agents have documented identities and humans don't. That's backwards.

If machines are going to understand us, work with us, and represent us — maybe we should be as explicit about who we are as they're required to be.

Not for the machines. For ourselves.

Elsewhere I've written about the [deeper philosophical roots](/notes/intentional-identity/) of this idea — why articulating identity is a practice that predates AI by decades. But the practical version is simple.

`SOUL.md` isn't just an agent spec. It's a practice of self-knowledge. And in a world that's about to get very weird, knowing who you are might be the most important thing you can write down.

*My own `SOUL.md` and `SKILL.md` are on my [About page](/about/). Feel free to steal the format.*
