Before autofocus, cameras had a secret weapon: the split-prism viewfinder.

Look through an old SLR and you'd see it—a small circle in the center of the frame, divided in half. When your subject was out of focus, the two halves didn't align. A face would be split down the middle, offset. Unsettling.

Turn the focus ring. Watch the halves slide toward each other. The moment they aligned—*click*—you knew. Not because the camera told you. Because you could *see* it.

## The Interface Taught the Skill

Here's what's remarkable: the split-prism wasn't just showing you focus state. It was **teaching you to see focus**.

After enough time with a split-prism camera, you started noticing alignment everywhere. Edges. Contrast. The micro-shimmer of perfect sharpness versus the softness of near-miss. The interface trained your perception.

Modern autofocus is better in every measurable way. Faster. More accurate. Works in low light. But it doesn't teach you anything. You point, it focuses, you don't know why.

## Legible Interfaces

<!-- TODO: Expand on what makes an interface "legible" vs just "usable" -->

The split-prism is a **legible interface**. It doesn't just work—it shows its work. You understand *why* things are in focus because you participated in getting them there.

Most modern interfaces optimize for usability at the cost of legibility. They hide the mechanism. They do things *for* you instead of *with* you.

This works fine until it doesn't. Until the autofocus locks onto the wrong subject and you don't know how to override it. Until the algorithm makes a choice you don't understand and can't correct.

## The 35mm Constraint

<!-- TODO: Connect to the fixed-lens Fuji X100 choice -->

This is why I shoot with a Fuji X100 now. Fixed 35mm lens. No zoom. No decisions about focal length.

The constraint isn't a limitation—it's a forcing function for *seeing*. When you can't zoom, you move. When you can't change the angle of view, you learn what 35mm sees. The constraint becomes invisible because you've internalized it.

Same with the split-prism. The interface disappears once you've absorbed what it teaches.

## Building Legible Systems

<!-- TODO: Software/systems implications -->

I think about this when building software. The best interfaces aren't the ones that hide everything—they're the ones that reveal just enough to build understanding.

A good error message doesn't just say "something went wrong." It shows you *what* went wrong, in terms you can act on.

A good dashboard doesn't just show metrics. It shows relationships—why this number affects that one, what levers you can pull.

**Legibility is the split-prism of software design.** Not showing everything (that's overwhelming), but showing enough that users develop intuition.
