# Coherence

*Fireside Chat — The Kinn, Venice*

---

Hi everyone — I'm Bri. Engineer, engineering leader, mom of a three-year-old — which mostly means I debug systems while extremely tired.

When people ask how I got into tech, I pause — because it wasn't a career decision. It was more like an instinct that eventually found a place to land.

Even as a kid, I was pulled toward figuring out how things worked. Taking things apart. Building. I told my mom one year I didn't want toys for Christmas — I just wanted scrap wood so I could build things in the garage.

I wasn't interested in playing with the finished thing. I was interested in understanding it. How it held together. Where it might fail.

That instinct never went away. Tech turned out to be a place where it was useful.

## Saying Yes Before You're Ready

Early in my career, I kept stretching into roles before I felt ready. More responsibility. Bigger decisions. More visibility. Usually arriving faster than my confidence.

People call that imposter syndrome. I used to think that's what it was.

But looking back, what I was actually learning was *calibration* — figuring out when I genuinely didn't know enough, versus when I did know enough and the room just hadn't caught up yet.

Here's what I figured out:

**Readiness usually comes *after* you say yes, not before.**

Growth doesn't feel like confidence. It feels like responsibility arriving early and asking whether you'll meet it.

## The Biggest Yes

A few years ago, I said yes to something that had nothing to do with my career — and everything to do with it.

I'm transgender. And I came out while already in leadership roles — which is not the order people usually recommend.

I want to be direct about this, because I think you can probably tell — and dancing around it would be weird.

What surprised me wasn't the transition itself. It was how much *clarity* it created.

For years, I'd been managing a low-grade static. Energy spent curating how I presented. Hedging. Monitoring. It wasn't dramatic — just constant.

When that static stopped, I got something back I didn't know I'd lost: **coherence.**

When I stopped hedging about who I was, I stopped hedging about my judgment.

I started trusting my own read on situations. Speaking more directly. Making faster decisions. Not because I suddenly knew more — but because I wasn't splitting my attention anymore.

**Authenticity isn't comfortable. It's coherent.**

And coherence, it turns out, is what makes trust possible.

## What Coherence Unlocks

Once I understood coherence in myself, I started seeing it everywhere.

**In systems:** The best architectures aren't the cleverest — they're the ones where every piece knows what it's for. Where the design is honest about its constraints. Where you can reason about one part without holding the whole thing in your head.

**In leadership:** The best leaders aren't the ones with all the answers — they're the ones you can predict. Whose values are legible. Who you trust to be the same person in a crisis that they are on a normal Tuesday.

**In care:** I used to confuse kindness with avoiding hard truths. I learned the difference between being supportive and being *enabling*. 

The deepest form of care isn't making people comfortable. It's refusing to let them settle for less than they're capable of.

That's coherence too — your actions matching what you actually believe.

## The Vehicle and the Destination

For a long time, I thought technical excellence was the goal. Build elegant systems. Make them scale. Make them correct.

What shifted — especially in leadership — was realizing that technical excellence is the *vehicle*, not the *destination*.

The destination is the human on the other side.

Every slow page load, every broken flow, every confusing experience — that's not just a technical issue. It's a small breach of trust.

**Code is how we decide what kind of world we're building for the people who use what we make.**

The craft matters. But it matters because of who it serves.

---

## What I Build Now

Today, my work is less about writing every line of code and more about designing environments — technical and human — where good work is easier than bad work.

Where excellence isn't heroic. It's inevitable.

Where standards are clear, tools help instead of fight you, and pride in craft is shared.

That's what coherence looks like at scale. Systems where every part knows what it's for.

---

## One Thing

If there's one thing I've learned, it's this:

The thing you're hedging about might be costing more than you realize.

Not because it's dramatic. But because managing static is expensive. When you stop splitting yourself, energy comes back.

The day my daughter started using my name without hesitation — that was the moment I knew coherence matters more than comfort.

That's been true for me. If something feels slightly off in your life — not catastrophic, just... misaligned — it might be worth asking what you're managing that you don't actually have to.

Thank you for being here tonight.
