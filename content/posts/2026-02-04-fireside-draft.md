# The Vehicle and the Destination

*Fireside Chat Script — Draft*

---

Hi everyone — I'm Bri. I'm an engineer and engineering leader, and also a mom, which mostly means I'm very familiar with debugging systems while extremely tired.

When people ask how I got into tech, I always pause a little — because it wasn't really a career decision. It was more like a long-standing instinct that eventually found a place to land.

Even as a kid, I was pulled toward figuring out how things worked. Solving problems. Taking things apart. Tinkering. Building. Trying to invent things that didn't really need to exist.

I actually told my mom one year that I didn't want toys for Christmas — I just wanted scrap wood so I could put things together.

I wasn't especially interested in playing with the finished thing. I was interested in understanding it. How it held together. Where it might fail. What would happen if I changed one piece.

That instinct — to poke at systems, to see where they break, to make them better — never really went away. Tech just turned out to be a place where that instinct was useful.

---

Early on in my career, I kept finding myself stretching into roles before I felt ready. More responsibility. Bigger decisions. More visibility. Often arriving faster than my confidence did.

And over time, I learned something that has stayed with me:

> **Readiness usually comes after you say yes, not before.**

That turned out to be true in more places than I expected.

People sometimes call that feeling imposter syndrome. That label never quite fit for me. What I was really learning was *calibration* — figuring out when I genuinely didn't know enough yet, and when I actually did, even if the room hadn't caught up.

A lot of growth doesn't feel like confidence. It feels like responsibility arriving early and asking if you trust yourself enough to meet it.

---

For a long time, I believed technical excellence was the goal. Build the best systems. Make them elegant. Make them scale. Make them correct.

What shifted for me — especially as I moved into leadership — was realizing that technical excellence is actually the *vehicle*, not the *destination*.

The destination is the human on the other side.

Every slow page load, every broken flow, every confusing experience isn't just a technical issue — it's a small breach of trust.

**Code is how we decide what kind of world we're building for the people who use what we make.**

---

Around the same time professionally, I also went through a pretty major personal shift. I became more visible about who I am — including being transgender — while already in leadership roles.

Which is… not the order people usually recommend.

What surprised me wasn't the transition itself. It was how much clarity it created.

When I stopped hedging about who I was, I stopped hedging about my judgment.

**Authenticity isn't comfortable. It's coherent.**

And coherence turns out to be the foundation of trust — in systems, and in leadership.

---

That clarity forced another lesson I didn't learn gracefully.

I care deeply about people. My instinct has always been to support, to give grace, to assume good intent.

And at some point, I had to confront the fact that I was sometimes confusing kindness with avoiding hard truths.

I learned the difference between being supportive and being *enabling*. Between creating psychological safety and quietly lowering the bar.

**The deepest form of care isn't making people comfortable. It's refusing to let them — or yourself — settle for less than they're capable of.**

---

Today, my role is less about writing every line of code and more about designing environments — technical and human — where good work is easier than bad work.

Where excellence isn't heroic. It's inevitable.

Where standards are clear, tools are supportive, and pride in craft is shared.

That applies far beyond software. It applies to teams, to leadership, and honestly, to life.

---

In a lot of ways, I'm still doing the same thing I did as a kid with scrap wood — trying to build things that hold together, and fixing them when they don't.

If there's one thing I'd leave you with, it's this:

**Growth rarely feels like confidence. It usually feels like responsibility showing up early.**

If you're in a season where you've said yes before you feel ready — professionally, personally, or both — you're probably closer than you think.

I'm really happy to talk, compare notes, or just hear what brought you here.

Thank you for listening.
