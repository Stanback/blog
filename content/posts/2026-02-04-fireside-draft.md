## Context (for me)

From my message to Tess:

> I'd love to regroup on the Fireside chat idea though. Today is a bit compressed with an appointment around 1pm, so either later this morning or tomorrow would be better on my end if that works for you. I also have some early, very rough thoughts on what it could look like, and a few things I'm still thinking through, which I'd be happy to talk through together.
