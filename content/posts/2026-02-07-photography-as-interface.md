## 2003: The Beginning

I got my first real camera in 2003 — a Canon 20D. Eight megapixels. Felt like magic.

I shot everything. Portraits of friends. Street scenes. My coffee. The light through my window at 6am. I didn't know what I was doing, but I was doing it constantly. The kit lens didn't matter. I was *seeing* for the first time.

## The Gear Acquisition Years

Then I learned about primes. A 50mm f/1.8 — the "nifty fifty." Suddenly: bokeh. Shallow depth of field. I could isolate subjects. My photos looked *professional*.

So I got more lenses.

A 35mm for street photography. An 85mm for portraits. A 24-70 zoom for versatility. A 70-200 for reach. Macro tubes for close-ups. Each one opened a new way of seeing.

Then the L lenses. Canon's red ring. Pro glass. The 24-70 f/2.8L. The 70-200 f/2.8L IS. Heavy, expensive, sharp as hell. I upgraded bodies to match — 40D, 5D Mark II, eventually a Mark IV. Full frame. More megapixels. Better low-light. Glass worthy of the sensor.

Then strobe flashes. Speedlites at first — on-camera, then off-camera with wireless triggers. Then proper studio strobes. Softboxes. Beauty dishes. Reflectors. Light stands. Sandbags. I could control every photon. Learned about ratios, modifiers, the inverse square law.

Then support. A proper tripod — not the $30 Amazon special, a real one. Carbon fiber. Arca-Swiss ball head. Then a gimbal for video. A slider for motion control. A drone for aerials.

There's a point where you don't have enough — where the gear is genuinely limiting what you can do. The kit lens really can't shoot in low light. The crop sensor really does give you less control.

And then there's a point where you have too much. I crossed it without noticing.

I had *options*. I could shoot anything. And that was the problem.

## The Cognitive Overload

And then I stopped shooting.

Not consciously. I just... did it less. Every time I thought about taking photos, there was a decision tree. What lens? What body? Do I need lights? Which modifier? Tripod or handheld? The creative impulse got buried under logistics.

I'd pack a bag with three lenses "just in case." I'd spend twenty minutes setting up lights for a shot that should have taken two. I'd miss the moment because I was changing focal lengths.

The gear that was supposed to enable creativity became a tax on it. Every additional option was another decision. Every decision was cognitive load. The load accumulated until the activation energy to just *take a photo* exceeded my motivation.

I had become a photographer who didn't photograph.

## The Constraint Epiphany

One day I left the house with just my phone. No bag. No lenses. No choices.

I took more photos that afternoon than I had in the previous month.

They weren't technically better. The dynamic range was worse. The bokeh was computational fakery. But I was *seeing* again. Noticing light. Finding compositions. Reacting to moments instead of preparing for them.

The constraint freed me.

## Diverge, Then Converge

Here's what I learned: **the wide exploration wasn't wasted.**

I needed to try the 85mm to know I preferred the 35mm. I needed studio lighting to understand that I loved natural light. I needed the tripod to realize I shoot better handheld. The divergence — the casting of a wide net — was how I discovered my actual preferences.

But the divergence has to end. You explore, you learn, you narrow. You converge on the tools that match how you actually see.

The mistake is staying in divergence mode forever. Accumulating options without ever committing. Keeping the 70-200 "just in case" when you haven't touched it in two years.

**Diverge to learn. Converge to create.**

## The Software Parallel

I see the same pattern in software tools.

Early in a project, exploration is valuable. Try different frameworks. Experiment with architectures. Cast a wide net. You're learning what the problem actually is.

But at some point, you have to commit. Pick the stack. Accept the constraints. Stop re-evaluating every decision. The cognitive load of infinite optionality will kill your momentum.

I've seen teams stuck in permanent divergence — evaluating seventeen state management libraries, debating build tools for months, never shipping. The fear of choosing wrong becomes a way of not choosing at all.

The best engineers I know converge fast. They pick tools, learn their limits, and work within them. They know the constraint isn't a prison — it's a *frame*. A 35mm lens doesn't limit what you can photograph. It shapes how you see.

## What Cameras Taught Me

**1. More options ≠ more creativity.** Past a threshold, options become overhead. The activation energy to start goes up. The spontaneity goes down.

**2. Constraints reveal preferences.** You don't know what you like until you've tried the alternatives. But you only discover what you *love* when you commit to less.

**3. Gear doesn't see. You do.** A better lens won't give you better vision. At some point, the tool is good enough. The bottleneck is you — your eye, your attention, your willingness to show up.

**4. The best camera is the one you have.** Not because quality doesn't matter, but because *presence* matters more. The shot you take with your phone beats the shot you didn't take with your Hasselblad.

## The Kit I Actually Use Now

After all that — the lenses, the lights, the stands, the gimbals — here's what I reach for:

- **iPhone.** For 80% of what I shoot. Always with me. Good enough.
- **Fuji X100.** Fixed 35mm equivalent. No lens choices. Just see and shoot.
- **One softbox.** When I need controlled light. Not a whole studio — one light, one modifier.

That's it. Everything else is in a closet, available if I need it, not cluttering my decisions.

I take more photos now than I did with ten times the gear. And I enjoy it again.

## The Takeaway

Whether you're building software or building a photography practice: **diverge early, converge deliberately.**

Explore the options. Learn what's out there. But don't mistake exploration for creation. At some point, pick your 35mm. Accept what it can't do. Focus on what it can.

The constraint isn't the enemy of creativity. The constraint *is* creativity — it's the frame that makes the composition possible.

*Twenty-plus years since that Canon 20D. I still think about that 70-200. Sometimes I miss the reach. But I don't miss the weight — literal and cognitive. Some tools are worth the tradeoff. Some aren't. The only way to know is to shoot.*
