Before I wrote software for a living, I made photographs.

Not casually—obsessively. The kind of obsession where you check [Canon Rumors](https://www.canonrumors.com/) daily, refresh [DPReview](https://www.dpreview.com/) forums for lens sharpness debates, and spend more time reading about photography than actually photographing.

I was *that* guy. The one who could tell you the MTF charts for every L lens, who knew exactly when the 5D Mark III was rumored to drop, who had opinions about bokeh rendering that nobody asked for.

## The Gear Arc

It started with a Canon 20D in 2003. Then a 40D. Then a 5D Mark II—the camera that changed everything for video. Eventually a Mark IV.

The lenses accumulated: 24-70mm f/2.8L, 70-200mm f/2.8L IS. The holy trinity, minus the wide. Each one a small fortune, each one "necessary."

Lighting came next. First a couple of Speedlites, triggered wirelessly. [Strobist](https://strobist.blogspot.com/)—David Hobby's blog about off-camera flash—was my bible. He taught a generation of photographers that you didn't need studio strobes to make professional light. You needed understanding.

But understanding wasn't enough for me. I wanted *more*. So the Speedlites gave way to a portable studio setup. Softboxes. Light stands. Radio triggers. The full kit.

## The Inflection Point

<!-- TODO: Add the specific moment when gear stopped mattering -->

Somewhere along the way, the returns inverted. More gear didn't mean better photographs. It meant more decisions, more setup time, more friction between seeing something and capturing it.

The best photographs I ever made weren't with the Mark IV and the 70-200. They were moments I almost missed because I was fiddling with settings.

## Diverge to Learn, Converge to Create

Here's what I eventually understood: **you have to go wide before you can go deep.**

The obsessive gear research wasn't wasted. Neither were the forum debates or the lens comparisons or the lighting experiments. That divergence—exploring every option, understanding every tradeoff—is how you develop taste.

But taste isn't the destination. Taste is what enables convergence.

Today my kit is:
- iPhone (80% of photos)
- Fuji X100 (fixed 35mm lens—no decisions)
- One softbox

That's it. Not because I don't appreciate what a 70-200 f/2.8 can do, but because I *know* what it can do. I made that choice from knowledge, not ignorance.

## The Software Parallel

<!-- TODO: Connect to software/systems thinking -->

I see the same pattern in how I approach software now. Early in a project, divergence is valuable. Explore the options. Understand the tradeoffs. Read the forum debates about framework X versus framework Y.

But at some point, you have to converge. Pick the tool. Commit to the constraint. Stop optimizing and start making.

The photographers still stuck in gear acquisition mode? They're the developers still debating which framework to use for a side project they'll never ship.

**Diverge to learn. Converge to create.**
