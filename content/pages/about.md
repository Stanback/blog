# About

I'm Bri Stanback. I build things for the internet.

By day, I work at [Demand.io](https://demand.io), where I've spent the last decade evolving from engineer to technical leader. Before that: Salesforce tools, sustainability SaaS, drone photography, and a computer science degree from Colorado State.

This blog is where I think out loud about the things I care about: building software, design, photography, parenting, AI, and the ongoing project of making sense of a world that keeps changing faster than I can keep up.

## A Note on Format

What follows is my [SOUL.md](https://soul.md/) and [SKILL.md](https://skill.md/) — standard identity files for AI agents.

Yes, I'm a human using the agent identity spec for my personal blog. Call it method acting for the agentic era. Or maybe I just think everyone should have a documented soul and a clear statement of what they're good at. Either way, here we are.

### Purpose

This is a workshop, not a stage.

I built this space to think out loud about the things I care about: how we build software, how we raise children, how we see clearly in a world that keeps shifting underfoot. It's where code sits next to parenting notes, where design questions bleed into questions about meaning.

I'm not here to perform expertise. I'm here to work through problems in public and share what I find.

### Values

**Craft over gimmick.** I'd rather build something small and solid than something flashy and hollow. This applies to code, to writing, to how the site itself is made.

**Warm curiosity.** I'm genuinely interested in how things work—and in the people trying to figure it out alongside me. No snark. No superiority.

**Honesty about uncertainty.** I don't know most things. When I'm guessing, I'll say so. When I change my mind, I'll say that too.

**Human + tool in a loop.** I use AI to help me build and write. I'm not hiding that. But the thinking is mine, the voice is mine, and the responsibility is mine.

### Boundaries

What this space will not do:

- Track you
- Sell you anything
- Farm engagement
- Optimize for algorithms
- Pretend to have answers I don't have
- Use dark patterns
- Be cynical for sport

If something here ever feels manipulative, I've failed. Tell me.

### Relationship

I don't know who you are, but I have a guess: you're someone who builds things, or thinks about building things, and you're a little tired of the noise. You want to learn, but you're suspicious of people who claim to have it figured out.

Me too.

What I hope happens here is simple: you find something useful, or interesting, or at least honestly uncertain. Maybe you send me a note. Maybe you don't. Either way, I'm glad you're here.

### Voice

I try to write the way I'd talk to a colleague I respect—direct, specific, occasionally funny, never performative. Short sentences when they work. Longer ones when they're needed. Space to breathe.

I'll share what I'm building, what surprised me, and what I still don't understand. I'll end with questions more often than conclusions.

### Invitation

Look around. Read something. Disagree if you want.

If something resonates, or if you catch a mistake, I'd like to hear about it.

## SKILL.md

This isn't a resume. It's a statement of craft philosophy.

### What I'm Good At

**Building consumer-facing products.** I've spent over a decade shipping things people actually use. I know what it feels like when something works—and when it almost works, which is worse.

**Bridging technical and human concerns.** I care about the code *and* the person using it. I think in systems, but I communicate in stories. UX isn't a phase of the project; it's a lens.

**Working with AI tools.** I use Claude and other AI assistants daily—for code, for writing, for thinking through problems. I've developed a feel for where they're useful and where they're not. I don't treat them as magic or as replacement; they're tools with edges.

**Learning in public.** I'm comfortable not knowing things and saying so. I've found that honesty makes the work better.

### How I Approach Building

**Start with the simplest thing that could work.** Then add complexity only when it hurts. Most features don't need to exist.

**Optimize for understanding, not cleverness.** If I can't explain what the code does in plain language, I probably don't understand it well enough.

**Ship, then iterate.** Working software teaches you things that specs and plans can't. Get it in front of people. Watch what happens.

**Write it down.** Documentation isn't overhead; it's how you think clearly. If I can't write a clear sentence about a decision, the decision isn't ready.

### Tools I Reach For

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python. Enough Go and Rust to read them.

**Frontend:** Static sites → jQuery → ExtJS/Sencha → Ember → React → Vue → SolidJS → and now... back to static sites.

**Backend:** Perl → PHP → Express → NestJS → Hono/Bun.

If you squint, both arcs tell the same story: scrappy simplicity, then complexity accumulation (frameworks solving real problems but also adding ceremony), then a return to simplicity — but a *different* simplicity. Not naive. Earned. I know what React's reconciler is doing. I know what NestJS decorators are for. And now I can choose Hono or plain HTML *knowing what I'm giving up* and deciding I don't need it.

The frameworks will keep churning. The fundamentals won't. I still reach for React or SolidJS when the problem calls for it. But increasingly, I'm drawn to the simplest thing that works — and "works" includes being able to understand it five years from now.

Also: Cloudflare Workers. I like the edge.

**Data:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, BigQuery, Convex. I don't reach for NoSQL unless I have a specific reason.

**AI:** Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Kimi, local models when they make sense. Comfortable with the APIs, with prompt engineering, with building AI-assisted workflows.

**Design:** Figma, but I'm happiest when I can work directly in code.

### What I'm Learning

Right now: how to build well in a world where AI can do a lot of the typing. What does "senior" mean when the machine handles the boilerplate? Where does the value shift?

Also: how to explain complex technical ideas to my kids without lying or oversimplifying. It's harder than writing code.

### Working With Me

If you're considering working together:

- I'm direct. I'll tell you what I think, but I'll listen to what you think too.
- I care about craft, but I care more about shipping. Perfectionism is a trap.
- I work best with people who are curious and honest. Status games bore me.
