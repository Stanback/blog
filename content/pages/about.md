# About

I'm Bri Stanback. I build things for the internet.

By day, I work at [Demand.io](https://demand.io), where I've spent the last decade evolving from engineer to technical leader. Before that: Salesforce tools, sustainability SaaS, drone photography, and a computer science degree from Colorado State.

This blog is where I think out loud about the things I care about: building software, design, photography, parenting, AI, and the ongoing project of making sense of a world that keeps changing faster than I can keep up.

## A Note on AI

I use AI tools to help me build and write. Claude in particular. I don't hide this, and I don't pretend the work is entirely "mine" in the old-fashioned sense. But the thinking, the voice, the decisions—those are mine. The AI is a tool, not a co-author.

If you're curious about how I work with AI, I'll probably write about it here.
