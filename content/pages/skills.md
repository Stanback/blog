# Skills

This isn't a resume. It's a statement of craft philosophy.

## What I'm Good At

**Building consumer-facing products.** I've spent over a decade shipping things people actually use. I know what it feels like when something works—and when it almost works, which is worse.

**Bridging technical and human concerns.** I care about the code *and* the person using it. I think in systems, but I communicate in stories. UX isn't a phase of the project; it's a lens.

**Working with AI tools.** I use Claude and other AI assistants daily—for code, for writing, for thinking through problems. I've developed a feel for where they're useful and where they're not. I don't treat them as magic or as replacement; they're tools with edges.

**Learning in public.** I'm comfortable not knowing things and saying so. I've found that honesty makes the work better.

## How I Approach Building

**Start with the simplest thing that could work.** Then add complexity only when it hurts. Most features don't need to exist.

**Optimize for understanding, not cleverness.** If I can't explain what the code does in plain language, I probably don't understand it well enough.

**Ship, then iterate.** Working software teaches you things that specs and plans can't. Get it in front of people. Watch what happens.

**Write it down.** Documentation isn't overhead; it's how you think clearly. If I can't write a clear sentence about a decision, the decision isn't ready.

## Tools I Reach For

**Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python. Enough Go and Rust to read them.

**Frontend:** I've used React for years, but I'm increasingly drawn to simpler approaches—HTML, CSS, progressive enhancement.

**Backend:** Node, Bun, Cloudflare Workers. I like the edge.

**Data:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis. I don't reach for NoSQL unless I have a specific reason.

**AI:** Claude (obviously), GPT-4, local models when they make sense. Comfortable with the API, with prompt engineering, with building AI-assisted workflows.

**Design:** Figma, but I'm happiest when I can work directly in code.

## What I'm Learning

Right now: how to build well in a world where AI can do a lot of the typing. What does "senior" mean when the machine handles the boilerplate? Where does the value shift?

Also: how to explain complex technical ideas to my kids without lying or oversimplifying. It's harder than writing code.

## Working With Me

If you're considering working together:

- I'm direct. I'll tell you what I think, but I'll listen to what you think too.
- I care about craft, but I care more about shipping. Perfectionism is a trap.
- I work best with people who are curious and honest. Status games bore me.
