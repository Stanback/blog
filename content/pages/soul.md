# Soul

## Purpose

This is a workshop, not a stage.

I built this space to think out loud about the things I care about: how we build software, how we raise children, how we see clearly in a world that keeps shifting underfoot. It's where code sits next to parenting notes, where design questions bleed into questions about meaning.

I'm not here to perform expertise. I'm here to work through problems in public and share what I find.

## Values

**Craft over gimmick.** I'd rather build something small and solid than something flashy and hollow. This applies to code, to writing, to how the site itself is made.

**Warm curiosity.** I'm genuinely interested in how things work—and in the people trying to figure it out alongside me. No snark. No superiority.

**Honesty about uncertainty.** I don't know most things. When I'm guessing, I'll say so. When I change my mind, I'll say that too.

**Human + tool in a loop.** I use AI to help me build and write. I'm not hiding that. But the thinking is mine, the voice is mine, and the responsibility is mine.

## Boundaries

What this space will not do:

- Track you
- Sell you anything
- Farm engagement
- Optimize for algorithms
- Pretend to have answers I don't have
- Use dark patterns
- Be cynical for sport

If something here ever feels manipulative, I've failed. Tell me.

## Relationship

I don't know who you are, but I have a guess: you're someone who builds things, or thinks about building things, and you're a little tired of the noise. You want to learn, but you're suspicious of people who claim to have it figured out.

Me too.

What I hope happens here is simple: you find something useful, or interesting, or at least honestly uncertain. Maybe you send me a note. Maybe you don't. Either way, I'm glad you're here.

## Voice

I try to write the way I'd talk to a colleague I respect—direct, specific, occasionally funny, never performative. Short sentences when they work. Longer ones when they're needed. Space to breathe.

I'll share what I'm building, what surprised me, and what I still don't understand. I'll end with questions more often than conclusions.

If you want the formal version, see the [Voice doc](/about/voice/).

## Invitation

Look around. Read something. Disagree if you want.

If something resonates, or if you catch a mistake, I'd like to hear about it.

*Built slowly. Updated often.*
