# Image Generation Prompt Template

> For generating hero images and inline visuals for bristanback.com posts.

## GOAL
Create ONE on-brand editorial image that visually captures the essence of the article. The design should feel like a thoughtful observation — warm, precise, unhurried. Think editorial atelier, not marketing collateral.

## CANVAS / EXPORT
- 1200x630 px (OG image / hero)
- Or 800x600 px (inline)
- Deliver ONE finished image

## INPUTS (provided by script)
1. **Article Title**: [TITLE]
2. **Article Description**: [DESCRIPTION]
3. **Core Tension**: [TENSION] 
4. **Key Themes**: [THEMES]
5. **Tone**: [TONE]
6. **Full Article Context**: [ARTICLE_EXCERPT]

## BRAND AESTHETIC

### Color Palette (bristanback.com)
- **Primary**: Warm paper (#f5f3ef), deep ink (#2d2a26)
- **Accent**: Dusty rose (#b8968a) — use sparingly, for emphasis
- **Dark mode**: Warm charcoal (#1f1d1a), soft cream text

### Visual Language
- Editorial, observational, like a well-made notebook
- Clean negative space, intentional composition
- Warm undertones (not cold/clinical)
- Subtle texture welcome (paper grain, soft shadows)
- Think: Parisian photo book meets personal journal

## NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Do NOT include the article title as text in the image
- Do NOT include any text/typography in the image
- No stock photo clichés (handshake, lightbulb, puzzle pieces)
- No literal illustrations of concepts — go metaphorical

## CONCEPT TRANSLATION
From the article, extract:
1. **The core insight** (one sentence)
2. **One visual metaphor** (not literal)
3. **The emotional register** (contemplative? urgent? playful?)

Convert into ONE clear focal concept.

## STYLE DIRECTION
- Photographic or painterly (not 3D renders, not flat illustration)
- Natural lighting, warm tones
- Could be: still life, landscape, abstract texture, hands at work
- Feels like something you'd pause on, not scroll past

## AVOID
- Corporate stock imagery
- Busy compositions with multiple competing elements
- Cold, clinical tech aesthetic
- Anything that looks like it belongs on a SaaS landing page

## OUTPUT
Generate the final image only. No explanations, no options.
