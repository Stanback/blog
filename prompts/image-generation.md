# Image Generation Prompt Template

## CANVAS / EXPORT
- 1200x630 px (OG image / hero)
- Or 800x600 px (inline)
- Deliver ONE finished image

## INPUTS (provided by script)
1. **Article Title**: [TITLE]
2. **Article Description**: [DESCRIPTION]
3. **Core Tension**: [TENSION] 
4. **Key Themes**: [THEMES]
5. **Tone**: [TONE]
6. **Full Article Context**: [ARTICLE_EXCERPT]

## BRAND AESTHETIC — THE VINTAGE ATELIER

### The Core Vibe
**Open vintage leather journal on warm paper surface, sepia-toned.** This is the signature look. Every image should feel like it belongs in a Parisian design atelier from the 1960s — thoughtful, crafted, timeless.

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: Warm paper (#f5f3ef), sepia/amber tones, deep ink (#2d2a26)
- **Accent**: Dusty rose (#b8968a) — use on journal bindings, ribbons, subtle details
- **Lighting**: Soft natural light from the left, warm amber undertones throughout

### Signature Elements (use 2-3 per image)
- Open leather-bound journal or notebook
- Brass drafting compass, wooden rulers, vintage tools
- Hand-drawn diagrams, wireframes, architectural sketches (on left page)
- Elegant handwritten notes in cursive (on right page, not readable)
- Ribbon bookmarks in dusty rose
- Paper texture, aged edges, subtle wear

### Visual Language
- Editorial still life photography
- Clean composition with intentional negative space
- Objects arranged with care, not scattered
- Depth of field: sharp foreground, soft background
- Think: the desk of a thoughtful architect or designer

## NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Do NOT include readable text — only suggest notation/writing
- No stock photo clichés (handshake, lightbulb, puzzle pieces)
- No 3D renders, flat illustration, or digital/tech aesthetic
- No cold/clinical lighting — always warm
- No busy compositions — restraint is key

## CONCEPT TRANSLATION
From the article, extract:
1. **The core insight** (one sentence)
2. **What would be sketched in the journal?** (diagrams, systems, patterns)
3. **What tool represents the work?** (compass = precision, ruler = structure, etc.)

The journal's LEFT page shows the visual/diagram. The RIGHT page has handwritten notes.

## EXAMPLE PROMPTS THAT WORK

**For "Code Owns Truth" (systems/architecture):**
> An open vintage leather journal on a warm paper surface, sepia-toned. On the left page, a hand-drawn network diagram with nodes and connections in ink. On the right page, elegant handwritten notes in cursive script. A brass drafting compass rests on the journal. Soft natural light from the left, warm amber undertones throughout. Editorial still life in the style of a Parisian design atelier.

**For "Rapid Generative Prototyping" (design constraints):**
> An open vintage leather journal on a warm paper surface, sepia-toned. On the left page, faded architectural blueprints of a user interface wireframe grid. On the right page, handwritten notes about design constraints in elegant cursive script. A brass drafting compass and wooden ruler rest on the pages. Soft natural light from the left, warm amber undertones. Dusty rose accent on the journal binding.

**For "Memory and Journals" (personal/reflective):**
> An open vintage leather journal with aged pages, sepia-toned. On the left page, a hand-drawn timeline or branching diagram. On the right page, faded handwritten entries. A brass fountain pen rests in the crease. Warm morning light, paper texture visible. Ribbon bookmark in dusty rose.

## AVOID
- Modern/digital aesthetic
- Cold lighting or blue tones
- Multiple competing focal points
- Anything that looks like a tech company blog
- Literal interpretations — go metaphorical through the journal lens

## OUTPUT
Generate the final image only. No explanations, no options. Always include the vintage journal as the central element.
