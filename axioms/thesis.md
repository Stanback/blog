# Thesis Axiom

> The homepage is not a lobby. It is a filter that answers: "Can I trust this person's filter of the world?"

## Current Thesis (v1.0)

**Software is no longer scarce. Judgment is.**

I build systems, interfaces, and identities that survive AI abundance.

## Changelog

| Version | Date | Change | Reason |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| v1.0 | 2026-02-04 | Initial thesis | Launch |

## Rules for Revision

1. **Change the thesis when your worldview changes**, not when you feel pressure to be fresh
2. **Archive old theses** in the changelog above (transparency)
3. **Never apologize for past positions** — show the evolution
4. **Rate of change:** expect 1-2 major thesis revisions per year maximum
5. **Test against the original physics:** Does this still answer "Can I trust this person's filter?"

## Signature Claims

The 3-5 ideas people should associate with this blog:

| Claim | One-liner |
|-------|-----------|
| **Judgment is the last moat** | Execution is cheap. Discernment isn't. AI compresses the gap but can't close it. |
| **Code owns truth** | Prompts express intent. Code is the artifact that persists. Constraints > mutations. |
| **Design physics over design rules** | Don't prescribe behavior — shape the space where behavior happens. |
| **Cost signals authenticity** | Humans are legible through what things cost them. Skin in the game beats polish. |
| **AI changes what we do, not whether we matter** | The shift is from maker to orchestrator. Both are real work. |

These claims should recur across posts — sometimes explicitly, sometimes as subtext. They're the throughline.

## The Physics

### Signal > Storage
The blog must optimize for meaning transfer, not idea accumulation. If the author does not decide what matters most, the network will decide — poorly.

### Taste Is the Trust Primitive
In an era of AI abundance:
- Competence is assumed
- Structure is table stakes
- **Taste is the differentiator**

Taste is visible through: what is foregrounded, what is omitted, how strongly a worldview is stated.

### Reduce Cognitive Load First
Humans will not parse your archive to understand you. The site must:
- Collapse worldview early
- Reduce choice anxiety
- Provide a clear "start here"

### Quiet Requires Leverage
Minimalism only works when reputation does the signaling. If unknown:
- Silence reads as absence
- Restraint reads as underinvestment

The site must earn quiet over time.

## Homepage Components

### 1. The Thesis Block (Top ~30%)
- Opinionated
- Falsifiable
- Revisable
- No biography, no tool lists, no vague abstractions

### 2. Reader Orientation (Below Thesis)

> Orientation is inclusiveness. Don't assume readers know why you're worth listening to.

A brief block that answers:
- What kind of thinking happens here
- Who it's for
- What it's not (optional)

**Example:**
```
This is a space for thinking about judgment, systems, and design
in an era where execution is cheap and discernment isn't.

For builders who are curious and tired of performative certainty.
```

**Rules:**
- 2-3 sentences max
- Not marketing — cognitive scaffolding
- Subtle typography (not hero text)
- Can evolve with thesis

### 3. Start Here (Curated Relevance)

3-5 editorially chosen essays that:
- Are most **accessible** (low jargon, clear entry point)
- Are most **representative** (show range without confusion)
- Are most **human** (reveal cost, not just clarity)

**Selection criteria:**
- At least one essay per pillar
- At least one that shows vulnerability
- Chronology is subordinate to curation

**Label:** "If you're new, these are good entry points."

**Not a "best of"** — an orientation.

### 4. The Network Layer
- `llms.txt` — AI discovery
- RSS — syndication
- SOUL.md / SKILLS.md — identity manifests
