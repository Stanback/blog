# Thesis Axiom

> The homepage is not a lobby. It is a filter that answers: "Can I trust this person's filter of the world?"

## Current Thesis (v1.0)

**Software is no longer scarce. Judgment is.**

I build systems, interfaces, and identities that survive AI abundance.

## Changelog

| Version | Date | Change | Reason |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| v1.0 | 2026-02-04 | Initial thesis | Launch |

## Rules for Revision

1. **Change the thesis when your worldview changes**, not when you feel pressure to be fresh
2. **Archive old theses** in the changelog above (transparency)
3. **Never apologize for past positions** — show the evolution
4. **Rate of change:** expect 1-2 major thesis revisions per year maximum
5. **Test against the original physics:** Does this still answer "Can I trust this person's filter?"

## The Physics

### Signal > Storage
The blog must optimize for meaning transfer, not idea accumulation. If the author does not decide what matters most, the network will decide — poorly.

### Taste Is the Trust Primitive
In an era of AI abundance:
- Competence is assumed
- Structure is table stakes
- **Taste is the differentiator**

Taste is visible through: what is foregrounded, what is omitted, how strongly a worldview is stated.

### Reduce Cognitive Load First
Humans will not parse your archive to understand you. The site must:
- Collapse worldview early
- Reduce choice anxiety
- Provide a clear "start here"

### Quiet Requires Leverage
Minimalism only works when reputation does the signaling. If unknown:
- Silence reads as absence
- Restraint reads as underinvestment

The site must earn quiet over time.

## Homepage Components

### 1. The Thesis Block (Top ~30%)
- Opinionated
- Falsifiable
- Revisable
- No biography, no tool lists, no vague abstractions

### 2. The Proof (Curated Relevance)
**"Start Here"** — 3-5 editorially chosen essays that support the thesis.

Chronology is subordinate to curation.

### 3. The Network Layer
- `llms.txt` — AI discovery
- RSS — syndication
- SOUL.md / SKILLS.md — identity manifests
