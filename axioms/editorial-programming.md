# Editorial Programming Axiom

> Build a themed body of work with deliberate variation in form, evidence, and endings.

## Purpose

A coherent theme should compound insight, not repeat cadence.

This axiom prevents "same post, different wrapper" by forcing structural and rhetorical variety across a sequence.

## Core Principle

Keep the thesis stable. Rotate the mode.

- Stable: worldview, long-term questions, recurring domain.
- Rotating: narrative shape, evidence type, level of abstraction, ending style.

## 8-Piece Program (Default Sequence)

Use this as the baseline cycle for a themed run. Do not publish two adjacent pieces in the same mode.

1. Field Note
- One concrete moment.
- Minimal framework language.
- Goal: witness and specificity.

2. System Spec
- Clear model, definitions, constraints, failure modes.
- Minimal memoir.
- Goal: transferable thinking artifact.

3. Case File
- One real failure or near-miss.
- Include receipts: what happened, what changed, what still hurts.
- Goal: credibility through consequence.

4. Counterposition
- Argue against one of your prior claims.
- Keep the old claim intact, then show where it breaks.
- Goal: avoid ideological lock-in.

5. Protocol
- Step-by-step operating method someone can run.
- Should be testable in the real world.
- Goal: behavioral utility.

6. Letter
- Address a specific person/group (future self, daughter, team, builder cohort).
- Keep stakes personal and explicit.
- Goal: emotional range without vagueness.

7. Forecast + Bet
- Make falsifiable predictions with a time horizon.
- Include what evidence would invalidate the prediction.
- Goal: intellectual accountability.

8. Revision
- Revisit earlier pieces in the sequence.
- Keep, revise, or retract claims with reasons.
- Goal: show evolution, not just output volume.

## Novelty Gate (Per Piece)

Each piece must introduce exactly one primary novelty axis:

1. New model
2. New evidence
3. New contradiction
4. New audience lens

If none are new, publish as an update to an existing canonical post, not a standalone piece.

## Lexical Drift Guard

Track repeated anchor terms (for example: "judgment", "constraints", "physics").

If the same anchors dominate 3+ consecutive pieces:

1. Ban those anchors for one piece.
2. Explain the same idea through different vocabulary and examples.

## Ending Rotation

Rotate endings on purpose across a sequence:

1. Hard claim
2. Protocol/next action
3. Falsifiable bet
4. Open question

Avoid repeating the same ending style in consecutive pieces.

## Notes vs Posts Discipline

- Notes: cognition-in-public, partials, open loops, in-progress synthesis.
- Posts: argued model or decision-grade artifact with explicit stakes.

If a note reads like a complete argument, promote it.
If a post is mostly exploratory fragments, demote it.

## Sequence Review (Every 8 Pieces)

At the end of each cycle, audit the set:

1. Which piece added the most net-new value?
2. Which piece repeated prior work?
3. Which claim needs revision?
4. Which mode is underused?

Then plan the next cycle intentionally instead of continuing by momentum.
