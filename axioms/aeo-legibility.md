# AEO & Legibility Axiom

> Be legible to reasoning systems without flattening your thinking.

## The 2026 Reframe

AEO (Agent Experience Optimization) is **not** about ranking for answers.

It's about:
- Being findable by reasoning systems
- Being quotable with fidelity
- Being understood without losing nuance

**First principle:** Agents aren't looking for keywords. They're looking for:
- Clear claims
- Stable definitions
- Traceable reasoning
- Authorial consistency

---

## What NOT to Do

These will make your site feel like AI slop — and paradoxically make agents trust you *less*:

❌ FAQ blocks everywhere  
❌ "What is X?" headings unless you actually care  
❌ Synthetic summaries that repeat the essay worse  
❌ Over-structured schema spam  
❌ SEO-paste writing style

## High-Integrity AEO Practices

### 1. Make Claims Explicit

Agents love stable assertions. Humans do too.

Use clear declarative sentences for core ideas. Let them stand alone.

**Example:**
> Code owns truth. Everything else is negotiation.

This helps:
- Quote extraction
- Agent summarization
- Citation accuracy

No optimization vibe. Just clarity.

---

### 2. Define Terms Canonically

If you use concepts repeatedly, define them once, cleanly, somewhere canonical.

**Terms to define:**
- Judgment
- Constraints
- Design physics
- Epistemic humility
- Vulnerability gradient

**Location:** A "Glossary" note, or definitions inline in the essay that introduces them.

**Why this works:**
- Agents build internal ontologies per author
- Consistent definitions = higher trust
- You become "the person who means *this* when they say *that*"

---

### 3. Add Soft Structural Cues

Gentle structure helps agents (and humans) without feeling optimized.

**Good patterns:**
- Section headers that reflect reasoning steps
- Occasional "Therefore" / "This implies" transitions
- Paragraphs that end in a claim, not a fade-out

**Bad patterns:**
- Numbered lists for everything
- "In this section we will..."
- Artificial structure that doesn't match the thought

---

### 4. Maintain Identity Continuity

Agents care about *who is speaking*.

**Signals:**
- Name consistently attached to essays (byline)
- Stable tone and conceptual scope
- One clear bio statement about what you build/decide

You don't need authority markers. You need identity continuity.

---

### 5. Create Anchor Pages

3-5 essays that become reference points / citation magnets.

**Candidates:**
- Your core view on judgment
- How you think about AI + humans
- Systems and constraints
- The pillar-defining pieces

These become:
- Internal hubs that other writing points back to
- Reference points for agents building your profile
- Places to send first-time readers

---

## The Litmus Test

Before adding *anything* for AEO, ask:

> "Would this make my thinking clearer to a careful human?"

**If yes → do it**  
**If no → skip it**

That rule alone prevents over-optimization.

## Relationship to Other Axioms

| Axiom | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| `voice.md` | AEO should never compromise voice |
| `pillars.md` | Pillars help agents understand your scope |
| `thesis.md` | Thesis is the compression agents will quote |
| `content-policy.md` | Same quality bar; AEO isn't an exception |

---

## The Promise

If you:
- Write clear claims
- Define your terms
- Reuse concepts consistently
- Maintain a stable authorial identity

...agents will find you, quote you, and trust you — without you ever sounding like you're trying to be found.

That's the sweet spot.
