# Pillars Axiom

> The architectural spine of this site. Everything maps to these.

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Judgment & Epistemology
How we know what we know. When to trust. Calibration.

**Includes:**
- Proof vs Truth
- Confidence and uncertainty
- The limits of verification
- When systems fail

**Key question:** *How do we know what we know?*

---

### 2. Systems & Constraints
Code, architecture, design physics.

**Includes:**
- Code owns truth
- Constraints as the design layer
- What survives context windows
- Harness engineering

**Key question:** *What structures make good outcomes inevitable?*

---

### 3. Interfaces
Human ↔ machine. Agent UX. Tools.

**Includes:**
- Design physics (the 2×2)
- Agentic UX
- The three-layer model (constraints → prompts → code)
- Tools and workflow

**Key question:** *How do humans and machines collaborate?*

---

### 4. Identity & Authorship
Voice, authenticity, AI co-creation.

**Includes:**
- Working with AI
- What it means to publish
- The vulnerability gradient
- Memory and continuity

**Key question:** *What makes work distinctly human?*

## Usage

### As a Filter
Before publishing, ask: which pillar(s) does this serve?
- If it maps to at least one → probably belongs
- If it maps to none → maybe it's not for this site

### As Organization
Tags and wikilinks naturally cluster around pillars.
The knowledge graph should show pillar-shaped neighborhoods.

### As Evolution
Pillars can change, but slowly.
- Expect 0-1 pillar changes per year
- Log changes in a changelog
- Don't chase novelty

---

## Not a Manifesto

These are internal scaffolding, not marketing copy.

Surface options:
- **Not at all** — just use as mental filter
- **Subtle** — as section descriptors or tags
- **Explicit** — on a "How this site works" page

Current recommendation: subtle (descriptors) or implicit (just the filter).

## Relationship to Other Axioms

| Axiom | Relationship |
|-------|--------------|
| `thesis.md` | Pillars support the thesis; thesis is the compression |
| `voice.md` | Pillars are *what* you write about; voice is *how* |
| `content-types.md` | Any type can serve any pillar |
| `aeo-legibility.md` | Pillars help agents understand your scope |
