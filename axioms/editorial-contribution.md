# Editorial Contribution Axiom

> Every published piece must add net-new value to the body of work.

## Purpose

This axiom prevents thesis repetition and keeps the archive compounding instead of looping.

In practice: a draft should not ship just because it is well-written. It should ship because it contributes something that did not exist on the site before.

## The Contribution Gate (Required)

Before publishing a post or note, the draft must pass all four checks:

1. Claim Delta
- One sentence: "This piece adds X that existing pieces do not add."

2. Evidence Delta
- Include at least one concrete artifact not previously used:
- New experiment, production failure, metric, source, case study, or first-hand scene.

3. Model Delta
- Add one net-new model/framework, or materially revise an existing one.

4. Reader Delta
- State what the reader can now do, decide, or see differently after reading.

If any check fails, do not publish as a standalone piece.

## Fallback Paths

When a draft is strong but not net-new:

1. Fold into an existing canonical post as an update section.
2. Convert to a short note that explicitly explores uncertainty.
3. Keep as private draft until a true delta emerges.

## Scope by Content Type

- Posts: Must pass all four checks.
- Notes: May be lighter on model depth, but must still show claim/evidence/reader delta.
- Pages: Exempt unless they present new arguments.

## Anti-Patterns

- Better wording of an old thesis without new evidence.
- New metaphors for an existing model with no behavioral implication.
- Publishing because cadence demands output.
- Reframing consensus takes as personal insight without first-hand cost.

## Editorial Test

If a reader asks "How is this different from your last three pieces?" the answer should be immediate, specific, and defensible.
