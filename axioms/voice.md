# Voice Axiom

> The site should feel like a digital atelier: precise craft, warm light, honest work-in-progress.

## North Star

**Reader experience in one line:** "I'm in the workshop with a senior builder who can also see."

## Audience

| Audience | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Senior-ish builders/designers who are curious and tired of performative certainty |
| **Secondary** | Thoughtful humans (parents, creatives) who don't mind code if it comes with meaning |
| **Not for** | SEO skimmers, hustle culture tourists, doomers |

## Do

- Use first person
- Admit uncertainty ("I'm not sure", "This might be wrong")
- Share failures, not just wins
- Include code when relevant (but explain it)
- Reference specific tools, versions, dates
- End with questions, not conclusions
- Be direct but warm

## Human Cost Signals

> AI is good at clarity. Humans are legible through *cost*.

For every essay, include at least one of:

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **A changed belief** | "I used to think X. I was wrong in a quiet, expensive way." |
| **A misstep** | "This broke in production on a Tuesday." |
| **A moment of doubt** | "I'm not sure this is right, but I'm publishing anyway." |
| **A concrete scene** | Time, place, tension — not abstraction |

One sentence is enough. Not every post needs all four.

**Why this matters:** The slightly-too-clean voice invites "AI adjacency" suspicion. Cost signals are anti-slop markers that build long-term trust.

## Situated Authority

Authority ≠ intensity. Earned authority > asserted authority.

Quiet credibility signals:
- What you've built
- What you've been responsible for
- What kinds of decisions you've owned
- What it cost to learn this

**Not a resume.** A perspective rooted in experience.

Example:
> "These ideas come from building systems where mistakes were expensive and ambiguity was unavoidable."

This positions voice without performing expertise.

## Don't

- Write like ChatGPT ("In this article, we will explore...")
- Optimize for SEO keywords
- Use buzzwords without defining them
- Pretend to have answers you don't have
- Be cynical for the sake of it
- Use "we" when you mean "I"
- Add filler phrases ("It's worth noting that...")

## Microcopy Guidelines

### Navigation
```
Posts          (not "Blog" or "Articles")
Notes          (not "Thoughts" or "Quick Takes")
Photos         (not "Gallery" or "Portfolio")
About          (not "About Me" or "Bio")
```

### Empty States
```
"Nothing here yet."           (not "No content found")
"Check back soon."            (not "Please check back later")
```

### 404
```
"Page not found."
"It might have moved, or maybe it never existed."
"Go home →"
```

### Footer
```
"Built slowly. Updated often."    (not "© 2026 All Rights Reserved")
```

## Content Scaffolding

When starting a new post, fill these fields in frontmatter:

```yaml
tension: "What's unresolved? What am I wrestling with?"
questions:
  - "What would you do differently?"
  - "Am I missing something obvious?"
```

These prompts prevent false certainty and invite dialogue.
