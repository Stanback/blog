## Why Write at All? (The AI-Era Question)

In a world where AI can generate infinite content, what's the point of a blog?

**Not information.** AI can synthesize information on demand. Regurgitating or aggregating existing knowledge is now table stakes.

**Testimony.** The value is that *you* thought this was worth writing. Someone with a name, a position, stakes, and history saying "I believe this, and here's why."

| AI commoditizes | Blogs still provide |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Information synthesis | **Situated perspective** — your view from *somewhere* |
| How-to content | **Stakes** — real consequences if you're wrong |
| Basic analysis | **Accumulated context** — evolution of thought over time |
| Summarization | **First-person testimony** — "I tried this, here's what happened" |
| Consensus views | **Provocation** — positions AI won't take |

**The litmus test:** Could this have been generated by an AI given the same prompt? If yes, push further. Not louder — more *owned*, more *situated*, more *costly*.

The blog's value isn't the information. It's proof that Bri Stanback thought it was worth writing.

## North Star

**Reader experience in one line:** "I'm in the workshop with a senior builder who can also see."

## Audience

| Audience | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Senior-ish builders/designers who are curious and tired of performative certainty |
| **Secondary** | Thoughtful humans (parents, creatives) who don't mind code if it comes with meaning |
| **Not for** | SEO skimmers, hustle culture tourists, doomers |

## Do

- Use first person
- Admit uncertainty ("I'm not sure", "This might be wrong")
- Share failures, not just wins
- Include code when relevant (but explain it)
- Reference specific tools, versions, dates
- End with questions, not conclusions
- Be direct but warm

## Human Cost Signals

> AI is good at clarity. Humans are legible through *cost*.

For every essay, include at least one of:

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **A changed belief** | "I used to think X. I was wrong in a quiet, expensive way." |
| **A misstep** | "This broke in production on a Tuesday." |
| **A moment of doubt** | "I'm not sure this is right, but I'm publishing anyway." |
| **A concrete scene** | Time, place, tension — not abstraction |

One sentence is enough. Not every post needs all four.

**Why this matters:** The slightly-too-clean voice invites "AI adjacency" suspicion. Cost signals are anti-slop markers that build long-term trust.

## Situated Authority

Authority ≠ intensity. Earned authority > asserted authority.

Quiet credibility signals:
- What you've built
- What you've been responsible for
- What kinds of decisions you've owned
- What it cost to learn this

**Not a resume.** A perspective rooted in experience.

Example:
> "These ideas come from building systems where mistakes were expensive and ambiguity was unavoidable."

This positions voice without performing expertise.

## Owner-Mode, Not Observer-Mode

The writing gets sharper when you **own the claim** rather than describe it from a distance.

### Observer-mode (weaker)
- "I've been thinking about..."
- "It seems like..."
- "There's a tension..."

### Owner-mode (stronger)
- "Here's what's true."
- "This is the constraint."
- "If this is right, then X is no longer defensible."

**Rule of thumb:** If a paragraph could be written by "a thoughtful person on the internet," push one sentence further until it could only be written by you. Not louder. Just more owned.

## Signature Structure

The strongest posts follow this implicit pattern:

1. **Observation** — Something feels off / has shifted / no longer holds
2. **Reframe** — The old explanation doesn't work anymore
3. **New model** — A cleaner way to think about the system
4. **Implication** — What changes if this model is true

Make this explicit mentally, not visually.

## Craft Principles (Elements of Style)

> "Vigorous writing is concise." — Strunk & White

- **Omit needless words.** A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences.
- **Use active voice.** "The system failed" not "Failure was experienced by the system."
- **Put emphatic words at the end.** The stress falls on the final position.
- **Prefer concrete to abstract.** Specifics beat generalities.
- **Shorter openings, faster hooks.** Could paragraph 2 be paragraph 1? Could the thesis appear 20% earlier?
- **End with consequences, not vibes.** "If this is true, then doing X is no longer defensible." That's the move.

## The Quality Without a Name

Christopher Alexander's concept from *The Timeless Way of Building*: there's a quality that makes something alive, whole, comfortable, free, exact. You recognize it before you can name it.

This is what we're reaching for. It's related to:
- **Taste** — recognizing when something is wrong before you can articulate why
- **Judgment** — the thing AI can approximate but not own
- **Craft** — the accumulated cost of learning what works

When editing, ask: *Does this feel alive? Or does it feel assembled?*

The quality emerges from patterns that resolve forces. It can't be faked by following rules — but the rules point toward it.

## Don't

- Write like ChatGPT ("In this article, we will explore...")
- Optimize for SEO keywords
- Use buzzwords without defining them
- Pretend to have answers you don't have
- Be cynical for the sake of it
- Use "we" when you mean "I"
- Add filler phrases ("It's worth noting that...")

## Microcopy Guidelines

### Navigation
```
Posts          (not "Blog" or "Articles")
Notes          (not "Thoughts" or "Quick Takes")
Photos         (not "Gallery" or "Portfolio")
About          (not "About Me" or "Bio")
```

### Empty States
```
"Nothing here yet."           (not "No content found")
"Check back soon."            (not "Please check back later")
```

### 404
```
"Page not found."
"It might have moved, or maybe it never existed."
"Go home →"
```

### Footer
```
"Built slowly. Updated often."    (not "© 2026 All Rights Reserved")
```

## Content Scaffolding

When starting a new post, fill these fields in frontmatter:

```yaml
tension: "What's unresolved? What am I wrestling with?"
questions:
  - "What would you do differently?"
  - "Am I missing something obvious?"
```

These prompts prevent false certainty and invite dialogue.
