## Why Write at All? (The AI-Era Question)

In a world where AI can generate infinite content, what's the point of a blog?

**Not information.** AI can synthesize information on demand. Regurgitating or aggregating existing knowledge is now table stakes.

**Testimony.** The value is that *you* thought this was worth writing. Someone with a name, a position, stakes, and history saying "I believe this, and here's why."

| AI commoditizes | Blogs still provide |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Information synthesis | **Situated perspective** — your view from *somewhere* |
| How-to content | **Stakes** — real consequences if you're wrong |
| Basic analysis | **Accumulated context** — evolution of thought over time |
| Summarization | **First-person testimony** — "I tried this, here's what happened" |
| Consensus views | **Provocation** — positions AI won't take |

**The litmus test:** Could this have been generated by an AI given the same prompt? If yes, push further. Not louder — more *owned*, more *situated*, more *costly*.

The blog's value isn't the information. It's proof that Bri Stanback thought it was worth writing.

## North Star

**Reader experience in one line:** "I'm in the workshop with a senior builder who can also see."

## Audience

| Audience | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Primary** | Senior-ish builders/designers who are curious and tired of performative certainty |
| **Secondary** | Thoughtful humans (parents, creatives) who don't mind code if it comes with meaning |
| **Not for** | SEO skimmers, hustle culture tourists, doomers |

## Do

- Use first person
- Share failures, not just wins
- Include code when relevant (but explain it)
- Reference specific tools, versions, dates
- End with questions, not conclusions
- Be direct but warm

## Human Cost Signals

> AI is good at clarity. Humans are legible through *cost*.

Cost signals are what make writing feel lived-in rather than generated. They're not a checklist — they're the texture that emerges when you write from experience instead of about it.

| Signal | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **A changed belief** | "I used to think X. I was wrong in a quiet, expensive way." |
| **A misstep** | "This broke in production on a Tuesday." |
| **A concrete scene** | Time, place, tension — not abstraction |
| **Embodied detail** | The specific gear, the specific Slack message, the specific feeling |

**The test isn't "did I include a cost signal?" — it's "could someone else have written this?"** If the answer is yes, the post needs more of *you*, not more hedging.

**Anti-pattern:** Announcing doubt ("I'm still figuring this out") is not the same as dramatizing it. The gear-shelf paralysis in *What Cameras Taught Me* is doubt made visible through scene. "I'm not sure about this yet" is doubt announced from a safe distance. Prefer the first.

## Situated Authority

Authority ≠ intensity. Earned authority > asserted authority.

Quiet credibility signals:
- What you've built
- What you've been responsible for
- What kinds of decisions you've owned
- What it cost to learn this

**Not a resume.** A perspective rooted in experience.

Example:
> "These ideas come from building systems where mistakes were expensive and ambiguity was unavoidable."

This positions voice without performing expertise.

## Impact Over Credentials

Don't cite titles, team sizes, or years of experience. Cite what changed. What exists now that wouldn't without you?

The proof is in the reality, not the resume. In a world where one person can launch a billion-dollar company, credentials mean less than artifacts.

**Not this:** "I led a team of 12 engineers for 3 years."
**This:** "I built the system that handles 10M requests/day — it's still running."

**Not this:** "I have 15 years of experience in distributed systems."
**This:** "I've been wrong about caching in three different ways. Here's what I learned."

The credential says you were *present*. The impact says you *contributed to something that worked*.

**The reframe:** "I moved the river" and "I added water" aren't opposites — they're the same thing at different scales. Rivers don't move because someone heroically moved them. They move because water keeps being added. Contribution, over time, bends the current.

Claim the water you added. Know which rivers mattered. That's enough — and that's everything.

This is the funeral test, restated: not "what did I achieve?" but "did I contribute to things that mattered?" The answer isn't scale — it's alignment.

## Owner-Mode, Not Observer-Mode

The writing gets sharper when you **own the claim** rather than describe it from a distance.

### Observer-mode (weaker)
- "I've been thinking about..."
- "It seems like..."
- "There's a tension..."

### Owner-mode (stronger)
- "Here's what's true."
- "This is the constraint."
- "If this is right, then X is no longer defensible."

**Rule of thumb:** If a paragraph could be written by "a thoughtful person on the internet," push one sentence further until it could only be written by you. Not louder. Just more owned.

## Tendencies (Guidance, Not Rules)

These complement owner-mode. Use when they fit, skip when they don't.

### Invitational uncertainty
When genuinely uncertain, show it through the *material* — the thing you tried that didn't work, the question you can't resolve, the two options you're torn between. Don't announce uncertainty; put the reader inside it.

- ✗ "I'm not sure yet, but here's what I'm noticing..."
- ✓ Describe the two paths and why neither feels right

### Tag questions & direct address
Occasionally, invite response:
- "That's the pattern, right?"
- "You've felt this too?"
- "Here's what I want you to sit with..."

Sparing use. Zero is fine. One or two per piece at most.

### Strategic "we"
"We" is valid when the reader can nod in recognition — shared experience, not false consensus:
- ✓ "We've all read the 'AI will change everything' takes."
- ✗ "We believe that..." (when you mean "I believe")

### Naming the feeling
For major observations, consider naming what it *feels like*:
- "AI is faster than previous transitions. That's unsettling."

One named emotion per piece is plenty. Not every observation needs it.

## Finding the Thesis

First drafts capture real ideas but don't always know which one is the main one yet. Philosophical pieces struggle more — they have room to wander. Technical pieces have built-in structure (problem → solution) that keeps them focused.

**The move:** Find the one sentence in your draft that surprises you — the one you didn't know you believed until you wrote it. That's your thesis. Everything else either supports it or belongs in a different essay.

This is the editing question: not "is this good?" but "what's this actually about?" The answer is usually hiding in the middle of paragraph four, disguised as an aside.

---

## Signature Structure

The strongest posts follow this implicit pattern:

1. **Observation** — Something feels off / has shifted / no longer holds
2. **Reframe** — The old explanation doesn't work anymore
3. **New model** — A cleaner way to think about the system
4. **Implication** — What changes if this model is true

Make this explicit mentally, not visually.

### Frameworks as devices

The 2×2 grid, the comparison table, the named model — these are genuine contributions. A reader walks away with a mental model they can use. That's valuable and worth doing.

**But earn the framework.** Let the narrative build tension before the framework resolves it. The grid should feel like relief — "oh, *that's* the shape of this" — not like a table of contents. Christensen doesn't open with a 2×2 of disruptive vs. sustaining innovation. He tells you about the disk drive industry and the framework crystallizes out of the story. You remember it forever because you remember how you got there.

**Don't walk the grid.** Once you've proposed the quadrants, you don't have to tour each cell sequentially. That's where it starts reading like a slide deck. Pick the interesting cell, or the one you're wrong about, or the edge case that breaks the model.

**Let the model be imperfect.** The most convincing frameworks have one cell that doesn't quite work, and you say so. Four clean quadrants read as tidy. Three clean and one messy reads as honest.

**Vary the delivery.** Not every insight needs a quadrant. Some are better as narrative (this happened, then this, and here's what I think it means). The framework is one device among several — use it when the shape of the idea is genuinely two-dimensional, not as a default container for every argument.

## Craft Principles (Elements of Style)

> "Vigorous writing is concise." — Strunk & White

- **Omit needless words.** A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences.
- **Use active voice.** "The system failed" not "Failure was experienced by the system."
- **Put emphatic words at the end.** The stress falls on the final position.
- **Prefer concrete to abstract.** Specifics beat generalities.
- **Shorter openings, faster hooks.** Could paragraph 2 be paragraph 1? Could the thesis appear 20% earlier?
- **End with consequences, not vibes.** "If this is true, then doing X is no longer defensible." That's the move.

## The Quality Without a Name

Christopher Alexander's concept from *The Timeless Way of Building*: there's a quality that makes something alive, whole, comfortable, free, exact. You recognize it before you can name it.

This is what we're reaching for. It's related to:
- **Taste** — recognizing when something is wrong before you can articulate why
- **Judgment** — the thing AI can approximate but not own
- **Craft** — the accumulated cost of learning what works

When editing, ask: *Does this feel alive? Or does it feel assembled?*

The quality emerges from patterns that resolve forces. It can't be faked by following rules — but the rules point toward it.

## Don't

- Write like ChatGPT ("In this article, we will explore...")
- Optimize for SEO keywords
- Use buzzwords without defining them
- Pretend to have answers you don't have
- Be cynical for the sake of it
- Use "we" when you mean "I"
- Add filler phrases ("It's worth noting that...")
- Narrate your own structure ("Let me walk through...", "I want to walk through...")
- Use "I'm still figuring this out" as a reflexive closer — if you're genuinely uncertain, show what you're torn between
- Report feelings from a distance ("I've felt this for a year") — put the reader in the moment instead

## Microcopy Guidelines

### Navigation
```
Posts          (not "Blog" or "Articles")
Notes          (not "Thoughts" or "Quick Takes")
Photos         (not "Gallery" or "Portfolio")
About          (not "About Me" or "Bio")
```

### Empty States
```
"Nothing here yet."           (not "No content found")
"Check back soon."            (not "Please check back later")
```

### 404
```
"Page not found."
"It might have moved, or maybe it never existed."
"Go home →"
```

### Footer
```
"Built slowly. Updated often."    (not "© 2026 All Rights Reserved")
```

## Content Scaffolding

When starting a new post, fill these fields in frontmatter:

```yaml
tension: "What's unresolved? What am I wrestling with?"
questions:
  - "What would you do differently?"
  - "Am I missing something obvious?"
```

These prompts prevent false certainty and invite dialogue.
